            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This Faithful and Zealous <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Divinely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a Goſpel-Spirit and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and was of a True, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, Gentle and Humble Diſpoſition; and his Judgment was mix'd with <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to poor Souls; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Society was Sweet and Acceptable to all the Faithful in Chriſt, who had a True and Spiritual Knowledge of him, and Acquaintance with him. He ſincerely affected Chriſtian Humility, Poverty of Spirit, and Simplicity in Chriſt, beyond all Artificial <hi>Painting,</hi> and Humane <hi>Acquirements.</hi> And ſeeing the Vanity of all Airy <hi>Notions,</hi> Scholaſtick <hi>Craft,</hi> and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, he laid it all aſide, and was Refin'd from all that Droſs, eſteeming the pure Gold, the Heavenly Treaſure, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord above all; therein aſſerting his Sincerity and Innocency, when a <hi>Priſoner</hi> in about 1665, in Praiſe to the Lord God, who ſupported him in his Sufferings, Patience and Innocent Condition. Concerning which, pleaſe to obſerve his own Teſtimony inſerted here as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This is my Confidence in the Sight of the Lord God, and my Clearneſs before all People, that though I have been hated and perſecuted, and evil ſpoken of by many theſe many Years, yet it hath altogether been without Cauſe, I praiſe the Lord. For I can truly ſay, That I never ſought the Hurt of any Man living upon the Earth, though in Matters of Religion, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:97179:4"/>he was never ſo contrary to me, or againſt me: Yea, the <hi>Terrors</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Truth,</hi> did preſerve my Heart from ſeeking my own Revenges, but taught me ſtill to commit my <hi>Cauſe</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and he, according to his Word, did ſtill <hi>bring forth my Righteouſneſs as the Light, and my Judgment</hi> and <hi>Juſt Dealing as the Noon-day,</hi> Pſal. 37.5, 6. to his Holy Name's Praiſe, and my Soul's great Rejoycing; and did ſtill let me ſee, that the patient abiding of the Meek, is never forgotten of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo though I have been kept here (a <hi>Priſoner</hi>) above four Years for my pure Conſcience ſake to God, yet to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> under whom I Suffer, have I done no Harm, nor can think or intend them <hi>Evil;</hi> but have endeavoured in all things in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all Men, as thoſe that have known me from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning can witneſs. For I never drew <hi>Sword,</hi> nor Plotted againſt any, nor could ever perſwade any others ſo to do; but have ſtill lamented the <hi>Miſery</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> to ſee them, inſtead of Loving and Helping one another, contrariwiſe Hating, Biting, Devouring and Deſtroying one another.</p>
                     <p>So I reſt in the Bleſſed <hi>Peace</hi> of my <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>Sufferer</hi> for his Bleſſed <hi>Truth,</hi> Bleſſed for ever be his Name, who hath called me, and counted me worthy thereunto. <hi>But it will not be well with ſuch as hate the righteous Man,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Scripture:</hi> But my Heart can ſay, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And concerning <hi>Kings,</hi> and all that are in Authority, my Heart hath ſaid according to the Holy Doctrine of the Apoſtle, <hi>Lord Grant that they may Rule well, that it may be well with them in the latter End; and that we thy People, whom thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed to thy ſelf, may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Honeſty and Godlineſs under them, to thy Praiſe.</hi> And for this Cauſe pay we Tribute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This his own Sincere Account, appears truly agreeable to what the Holy Apoſtle ſaith in the like caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our Rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in Simplicity
<pb facs="tcp:97179:4"/>and Godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God we have had our Converſation in the World, and more abundantly to you-wards.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Divers <hi>Friends</hi> have been for ſome time concerned, that the following <hi>Collections</hi> were not publiſh'd ſome Years ago; but many Occaſions and Exerciſes intervening, have thus long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Perſons concerned in <hi>Collecting, Inſpecting</hi> and <hi>Placing</hi> his Writings in Order, as they could find them, and as might moſt tend to <hi>future Service,</hi> Admonition or Warning, that they might be preſerved for Ages to come.</p>
                  <p>We have great Cauſe to Praiſe the Worthy <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> that he hath raiſed and ſent ſo many Faithful Witneſſes in our Days, who have not been as <hi>Clouds</hi> without <hi>Rain,</hi> but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Repleniſhed and Qualified with <hi>Life, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> for the Work which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath called them unto.

                  <head>A TESTIMONY Concerning our Dear Friend and Brother Thomas Taylor, Who was Convinced of the Lord's Everlaſting Truth, and Received it in the Year 1652.</head>
                  <p>HE had been an Eminent <hi>Pariſh Prieſt,</hi> and of Note among the Profeſſors and other Prieſts, and alſo a <hi>Lecturer</hi> in ſeveral Countries, Preaching <hi>Sermons</hi> on the Week-Days. And he coming to <hi>Swarthmor</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> with ſome other <hi>Prieſts,</hi> I ask'd him and them, before <hi>Judge Fell,</hi> 
                     <q>Whether he, or any of them could ſay, that they ever heard a <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> from Heaven, that bid them go to Speak to any People, as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> did to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles?</hi>
                     </q> And <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid before them all, that he never heard any ſuch Voice or Command. And I ask'd him what he Preach'd to the People then, and he made Anſwer, and ſaid, <hi>His Experiences,</hi> and I told him his <hi>Experiences</hi> might not reach to every <hi>Condition;</hi> but he that had the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> might Preach it, whom God ſent, and that would Reach all <hi>Conditions,</hi> who knows all <hi>Conditions:</hi> And ſo the Lord's Word and Power ſtruck him that he was Silent. But the reſt of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were High, and Oppoſed, and came to nothing: And Judge <hi>Fell</hi> wondered, and was aſtoniſhed at what he heard <hi>Thomas</hi> ſay, that he had never heard the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Command him to Preach to any People; and the ſaid <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> being look'd upon a High <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and above the Common <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and a Sober Man, and Beloved among the outward <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and ſo I went along with him that Day, to a place called <hi>Newton,</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where he uſed to Preach ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and he was very much down, and ſad, and groaned that Night. And the next Day we went to a Meeting which we had in the <hi>Steeple-houſe-yard,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97179:9"/>but he would have gone into the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> but the <hi>Prieſt</hi> would not let us; and I told him, it was no matter. And there came another <hi>Prieſt</hi> from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Barrow,</hi> and ſeveral others, and <hi>Thomas</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill, at laſt a tender <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> Sprang up in him, and he Spoke very well in it to the People, both of his own <hi>Condition,</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's, and where they had been; and now how they muſt turn to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Barrow-Prieſt,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> were Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and Oppoſed him; but the Lord's Power came over them all: <hi>For</hi> he was look'd upon, in the time of his <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> above them,</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> grew in the Grace and Truth of Chriſt, and came to know the <hi>Word of</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> and Preach Chriſt Freely, as then he had Received Freely, and forſook his <hi>Pariſh-ſteeple-houſe,</hi> and his old <hi>Pariſh-wages,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that Preach'd for <hi>Hire;</hi> and he Travelled up and down in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> Preaching the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his Goſpel freely, as he was Commanded, who had Received it freely. And likwiſe his Brother <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor,</hi> who had been a Publick <hi>Preacher</hi> to a People, was alſo <hi>Convinc'd,</hi> and Preach'd Chriſt freely. And many <hi>Diſputes Thomas</hi> had with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and continued ſtill in his Confeſſion to God, and his Truth and People, and what their <hi>Conditions</hi> were, and had been formerly. And ſo from that time he continued in the Truth, and the Grace of God, and grew mightily in it, and boldly Preached it, and ſaw where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were, and by whom they were made and ſent, not of God; ſo that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> grew in a Rage againſt him, and Perſecuted him.</p>
                  <p>And he, having been a <hi>Lecturer</hi> at <hi>Richmond</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> was made to go there, and <hi>Turn his Back to the Prieſt, and put his Hands to both his Ears, and ſtop them,</hi> as a <hi>Sign,</hi> how God had ſtopt his <hi>Ears</hi> unto their Sacrifice, and Service, and Offering. And then after he was caſt into a <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Appleby</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> for the Truth's Sake, under a cruel <hi>Goaler,</hi> and a very bad <hi>Priſon,</hi> being a ſad, ſmoky place, by the Smoke that came out of other Rooms, enough to Choke him: But he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Faithful in the Life and Power of the Lord, and the Lord deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thence. And afterwards he Travelled up and down, Preaching to <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and warning all, both Small and Great, to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and Amendment of Life, turning many to the Lord. He was after a while caſt into <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>York</hi> for Truth, and after ſome time the Lord there delivered him. And ſo when he was at Liberty, he ſtill continued Labouring in the Work and Service of the Lord, Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel, and <hi>Turning People from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan, to the Power of God.</hi> And alſo his <hi>Life</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:97179:9"/>
                     <hi>Converſation</hi> Preached, being a Man of a Sober Life, and Sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a good Underſtanding in the Truth. And after he had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled much up and down in ſeveral parts of this <hi>Nation,</hi> he coming into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> was there <hi>Impriſoned</hi> and <hi>Premunired</hi> for refuſing to <hi>Swear</hi> in Obedience to the Command of Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and there he was kept <hi>Priſoner Ten Years and a half</hi> in the Town of <hi>Stafford,</hi> under cruel Goalers; and a ſore, tedious Impriſonment he had, and great <hi>Sufferings</hi> by thoſe <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> as his <hi>Letters</hi> will Teſtifie. and a weariſom Impriſonment he had through the wicked Priſoners, which burdened and grieved his Righteous Soul. And when he was at Liberty, and Travelled up and down in the Power of the Lord, in the Lord's Service, being a Man of a <hi>Tender Spirit</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſometimes he met with <hi>Bull-baiting, Bear-baiting, Plays</hi> and <hi>Shews,</hi> and <hi>Cock-fightings;</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> and <hi>Ringers</hi> of <hi>Bells,</hi> &amp;c. which burdened and grieved his Righteous Soul, that People ſhould ſpend their pretious Time in <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> and ſuch as profeſſed Chriſtianity, which were more like the <hi>Heathen-Romans</hi> than <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who was made to <hi>Admoniſh</hi> ſuch, and <hi>Reprove</hi> them (as his <hi>Letters</hi> Teſtifie) <hi>and not to ſpend their time ſo Vainly.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> was with him, and did aſſiſt him, who was an <hi>Elder</hi> indeed, and Partaker of the Glory, that is to be Revealed; who ſought to Eſtabliſh ſuch as he Convinced (and were Convinced,) in the Truth and Goſpel the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> who was <hi>Beloved of God, and all his Faithful People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And many bad <hi>Priſons</hi> or <hi>Goals</hi> he was caſt into for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Truth's Sake. And he had a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the very <hi>Scholars</hi> could ſay, <hi>That</hi> Thomas <hi>was too hard for him;</hi> for the Lord, with his Eternal Arm and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, did Support him. And he was a Faithful, True, Upright Man in the Lord's Truth, to the laſt, and turned many to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that they became Hearers and Followers of him who Speaks from Heaven: And he loved the Government of Chriſt, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Heavenly Order among his People. And when he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and finiſhed his Courſe (who was a harmleſs and blameleſs Man in his <hi>Converſation</hi>) he laid down his Head in Peace, and Died in the Lord, and is Bleſſed, and his Works follow him.</p>
                  <p>Much might be writ of this Honeſt and Faithful Servant of God <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi>'s cruel Hardſhips and Sufferings, that he went through for Chriſt, and his Truth's Sake. He finiſh'd his Days at <hi>Stafford</hi> with his Wife, in 1681. after he had been an able Preacher of the Goſpel from about 1652. And is at Reſt with the Lord: And</p>

                     <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor's</hi> TESTIMONY Concerning <hi>Thomas Taylor.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MY deceaſed Brother <hi>Tho. Taylor</hi> was a Man, who, in his tender Years, had a Sence of Sin upon him, and ſaw a Neceſſity of coming and attaining to a State of Righteouſneſs and Faithfulneſs to God that he might pleaſe him; ſo that for ſeveral Years he was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under the Spirit of Bondage and great Fears, leſt he ſhould miſs of Eternal Salvation, and ſo come to be a true Seeker and Inquirer after the beſt Things; and the Lord was Good unto him in a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Work, as I may ſay, before he came to know the Sabbath of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And as Light and Life appeared and ſprung up in its Meaſure in the Land of his Nativity, the Lord in Mercy gave him a Share in it, and a Fear came upon his Heart, to preſerve him in a State of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Simplicity, which kept him very Sober in his Converſation, and Reſtrained him from many Evils others fell into; ſo that he was accounted by many in thoſe days who were Honeſt-minded, to be a Religious Conſciencious young Man: And the Lord gave him Sights and Openings of good Things at hand, and opened a Door of Hope unto him, that he ſhould ſee the Lord's Bleſſed Day of his Heavenly and Powerful Appearance, and, with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> waited and longed for God's Kingdom, and Powerful Appearance unto his Soul. And when that bleſſed Inſtrument in God's Hand, <hi>George Fox,</hi> came into the North to preach and declare the Everlaſting Goſpel of Glad Tidings to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to ſuch who were waiting to be delivered from the Bondage of Sin and Unrighteouſneſs, this Dear Man was glad and was convinced of the Truth, which was demonſtrated in the Evidence of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Holy Power unto him and many others: So that the Light and Truth broke up in him, to the breaking of his Heart before the Living
<pb facs="tcp:97179:11"/>God, and the making of his Soul tender in Humility, and the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Spirit of true Judgment, and Burning ſeized on his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, and pure Tremblings before the Lord ſeized upon him, and Judgment did ſo effectually take place in the Operation of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Mighty God, that his Inward Man rejoyced, that now he was come to know one of the Great Days of the Son of Man. And the Work of the Lord was begun in his Heart, ſo that his Soul cried mightily to God for Judgment, to Judge and Condemn for ever, all that was Contrary to the Word of his Pure Power. And the Lord heard his true Cries, which himſelf, by his own Grace, had raiſed up in him, and extended his Mercies to him, and fulfilled that Saying, <hi>A bruiſed Reed ſhall be not break, and ſmoaking Flax ſhall he not quench, until he ſend forth Judgment to Victory.</hi> So Victory he came to know, and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his Soul, through the Exerciſe of Faith and Patience in the way of Righteouſneſs; and the Lord raiſed him up to be a living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Heavenly Power, and the breaking forth of its Bleſſed Day of Light, and ſent him forth to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, and to turn many to Righteouſneſs; and he became a Faithful Labourer and Servant of Jeſus Chriſt in his Harveſt and Vineyard, and many are his Witneſſes, how Faithfully he ſerved God, and how truly he cared for the Flock of Jeſus Chriſt, where-ever he came, and laboured in the Faith, as one wholly given up to Spend and be Spent, in that Work the Lord had committed to him. Many and Great were his Sufferings from Wicked Men who ſometimes lay in wait for him, to have taken away his Life; and tedious it would be to repeat the Hardſhips he underwent, and great Sufferings he endured, by the Malicious inſtruments of Satan. But the Lord delivered him thorow all the Scourgings, Buffetings and Evil Treatments of Unreaſonable Men. As to Impriſonment he ſuffered much in ſeveral Priſons in this Nation, as at <hi>Appleby</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> at <hi>York, Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> and laſt of all above ten Years Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Stafford,</hi> and was there Premunired becauſe he could not Swear. He was a Faithful Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, and kept his Bleſſed Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony over the Heads of Wicked Brutiſh Savage and Unreaſonable Men he met withall in his Impriſonments. It is hard to utter what he paſſed thorow in thoſe Evil Dens amongſt ſuch Savage Beaſts, but the Lord upheld him, bleſſed him, and delivered him out of all; and Dear and Near he was unto his God who upheld him, Everlaſting Honour be unto his Name: Deeply am I affected when I read him in the Sence of Life, how Safe the Lord kept him, ſo that the Courſe of his Life was Eminently Exemplary, ſo Grave, Tender and Humble he was, and Self denying. Well it is and will be for all who are ſo truly preſerved to God as he was, I am perſwaded none can juſtly tax his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb facs="tcp:97179:11"/>or preſent a Spot or Stain upon his Garment, whilſt he lived, after he was called to the Lord's Work and Service. Oh! have I ſaid in my Heart, What Happineſs is it to thoſe who are ſo kept and ſafely preſerved, to Honour God and Preach his Goſpel, as well in Life and Converſation, as in Words and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And as to his Teſtimonies in Writing, which are here given forth to be read, they are plain and eaſie to be underſtood by every unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Perſon that reads them in Simplicity with the Light of Chriſt, there are various things teſtified againſt the Sins and Evils of the Times, for he laboured much for the Nations and Peoples Good, that they might be kept out of Debauchery, Wickedneſſes, Games, Sportings and Evils of all ſorts, that if poſſible ſuch Evils as too much abounded in our Nation, might not have that Liberty, or Peſtilential Diſpoſition, as to Leaven and beget People further from God, and as a Leproſie to ſpread over the Nation. Alſo he was tender over the Lord's Innocent People, leſt they ſhould fall on the right Hand or on the left, and ſo loſe their Habitations in the Truth. He was right ſpirited to diſcern the Wiles of Satan, and to inſtruct and give Warning to ſuch as might be miſled into any Evil Condition under the Pretence of Truth to fight againſt it: I believe he was never known, ſince he preached the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel committed to him, to turn his Back of any Enemy, to give way to him, of what Size or Sort ſoever he was, or how Subtle ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Devil could make him, the Lord gave him a Sight beyond the Subtlety of Satan, and when he was Spent in the Service the Lord had called him unto, in a good old Age, he departed this Life, and finiſhed his Courſe with Joy and Everlaſting Rejoycing, to the Praiſe and Glory of the Everlaſting God, who for ever is to be admired of all his Saints, honoured and magnified for ever and for ever more, World without End. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>Thomas Taylor's</hi> TESTIMONY Concerning his FATHER.</head>
                  <p>A Short Teſtimony lives with me to bear for my Dear Father, <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> that True and Faithful Servant of the Lord, who was Born near <hi>Skipton</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and was brought up a Scholar and ſent to the Univerſity, and in proceſs of time he came to be a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Miniſter, and ſo continued for ſome Years; but in thoſe Days he had not many Equals, for he was a Man of a Tender Spirit, ſeeking after a further Attainment of the Knowledge of God and his Holy Way, <hi>whom to know is Life Eternal,</hi> which the Lord in his own due time made known unto him. After he had heard the Word of Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Demonſtration of God's Holy Spirit through his Faithful Meſſenger <hi>George Fox,</hi> he was then evidently Convinced of the Bleſſed Truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he never <hi>after</hi> turned his Back upon it; many Days and Nights of great Sorrow and Anxiety of Spirit he underwent, until the Old Leaven was purged out by the Spirit of Judgment, and then he became a Veſſel of Honour fit for the Lord's Service, and left his Benefice which he then had at <hi>Richmond</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> not conſulting with Fleſh and Blood what he ſhould do for a Livelihood, but truſted the Lord that he would provide for him and his Family, he having then a Wife and Five ſmall Children, whom he afterward, through the good Providence of God lived to ſee brought up to be Men and Women: Now this Faithful Servant of the Lord not diſtruſting of the Mercies of God, gave up freely whatſoever was Dear and Near unto him, that the Lord required of him, that he might win Chriſt the Lord, who had Viſited him with his Day-ſpring from on high, and Ruled him by his Grace, and gave unto him the Word of Life to declare unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, Warning and Admoniſhing them to turn from their evil ways, and to ſeek the Lord whilſt he might be found; and
<pb facs="tcp:97179:12"/>great was his Labours and Travels in thoſe Days, being moved often to go into Market-places and Steeple houſes, to declare the Word of the Lord to the People, where he often met with great Oppoſition and Sufferings from the Hands of Unreaſonable Men, but the Lord by his Mighty Power delivered him wonderfully out of their Hands, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long and tedious Impriſonments this good Man underwent in his Day, but with great Patience and Contentedneſs of Mind, knowing it was for his bearing his Teſtimony to the Lord's Bleſſed Truth, and not for evil-doing: And this I have further to ſay for this Worthy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Servant of Chriſt, who loved not his Life unto the Death, that he might ſerve the Lord in his Day, who was a Faithful and True Miniſter of the Everlaſting Goſpel, and laboured mightily in Word and Doctrine, and many in this Nation were Convinced by that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word of God that run through him, and they have great Cauſe to Bleſs and Praiſe the Name of the Lord, even as I may ſay on his behalf, for he was a Zealous Man for the Truth in his Day, and was one of the Worthies in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who went through many Combates both with Profeſſors and Prophane; and, by the Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, oftentimes put them to ſilence, and the Truth prevailed over all, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Name of the Lord for Ever.</p>
                  <p>And now not being willing to be too tedious to the Reader, elſe I could mention many more things concerning my Dear Father, who was a Faithful Follower of the Lamb whereſoever he led him, through good Report and bad Report, for he valued nothing ſo much in this World as the Propagation of the Truth, for his Life was hid with Chriſt in God, at whoſe Right Hand there is Joy and Rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that for Evermore. And a little before my Father's Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this World, as he lay upon his Sick-bed, ſeveral Friends that came to Viſit him ſtanding by him, he being very ſenſible to the laſt, ſpoke on this wife, <hi>I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God,</hi> and ſo departed like a Lamb, and is gone to his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt, to receive that weighty Crown of Glory that is laid up in ſtore for all them that loves the Appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and keeps their Garments unſpotted of this World.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HE being a Man with whom I was Acquainted and Converſant for the ſpace of Thirty Years, ſome part of our Acquaintance in the time of our Notion and Outward Profeſſion of Religion in the form thereof, but the moſt of our time was after God in Mercy had opened our Underſtanding, and revealed his Son in us by the Word of Life, and Spirit of Truth, to know Chriſt in us the Hope of Glory.</p>
                  <p>He was Educated and Bred up at one of the Colledges of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and became a Pariſh Preacher, and had a Place in the County of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi> yet in thoſe Days he was a Seeking Man, having Real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to underſtand the Things of God, and the Myſteries of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was a Man of an Honeſt Life, and Clean Behaviour, and in his Preaching and Judgment was more Refined than the reſt of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Prieſts, and many of his Hearers were a People commended of the Common Hireling Prieſts of the World, which Prieſts Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named his Hearers <hi>Roundheads</hi> and <hi>Puritans,</hi> and many of thoſe ſo called came frequently from the next Pariſh and Town of <hi>Kendall</hi> to hear him, amongſt whom I was one; and he uſed to let <hi>John Audland</hi> and <hi>Francis Howgill</hi> ſometimes Preach in his Pulpit in that Profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either he or they was clearly Convinced of or Come to the Eternal Truth, and awakened by the Power of God.</p>
                  <p>And in as much as that while he was a Publick Prieſt, he would not Baptize his Children at the Font, nor Sign them with the Sign of the Croſs, ſo that the other Prieſts were offended at him, and upon ſome Diſcourſe about it, they agreed upon a Diſpute to be held at <hi>Kendall</hi> Pariſh Steeple-houſe, where was a very great Auditory, and Three Prieſts appeared againſt him to prove Baptizing of Infants by Scripture, which they could not do, and he came over them all, and ſome of the
<pb facs="tcp:97179:14"/>Hearers run up <hi>Kendall-ſtreet</hi> crying, <hi>Mr.</hi> Taylor <hi>hath got the Day! Mr.</hi> Taylor <hi>hath got the Day!</hi> which Outcry grieved the Prieſts: This was in the Year 1650.</p>
                  <p>And about Two Years after <hi>George Fox</hi> came into <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> and Preached the Everlaſting Goſpel and Power of God, in the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit of Eternal Life, and many of thoſe called <hi>Puritans</hi> was Convinced and Broken by the Power of God.</p>
                  <p>And the ſaid <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> was almoſt left alone, it being a very great Croſs to become a Fool to the World, and loſe his Benefit, his Wife being a pretty high Woman, having Six young Children, and nothing elſe to live on, yet he gave up all, laying aſide all ſuperfluity of Naughtineſs, and received with Meekneſs the Ingrafted Word, which is able to ſave the Soul, and ſanctifie throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And ſhortly after <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife was Convinced, and laid aſide all her finery of Apparel, and truſted Providence for a Livelihood for her ſelf and ſmall Children, and became a very good Friend, and kept the Faith, and laid down her Head in Peace in the Town of <hi>Stafford,</hi> a Year or more after her Dear Husband Died, who Died and was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the ſame Town of <hi>Stafford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> having received the Truth of God in the Love of it, and denied himſelf in all things for the ſake of it, in a ſhort time he had his Mouth opened, by the Opening and Inſpiration of the Word of Life, by which his Soul was then quickened, and he concerned in the Motion of God, and Authority of his Name, to deſcribe the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pariſh Hirelings, ſo that they roſe up againſt him, and, by the Aid of the then Unbelieving Magiſtrates, got him to Priſon in <hi>Appleby</hi> Goal, where he grew in the Knowledge of God, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt Jeſus, and after he was releaſed out of Priſon, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abroad, and was a Living Inſtrument in the Hand of the Lord to the Convincing of many.</p>
                  <p>And he being a Man full of Zeal and Integrity, and being filled with the Spirit, was always in Truth's Service, that when he had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Road, he commonly had a Word of Caution to Profeſſor and Prophane; and ſome of his Old Hearers who did not receive Truth, I have ſeen him ſpeak to them on the Market-day in <hi>Kendall ſtreet,</hi> and ſometime go to their Houſes to exhort, admoniſh, and reprove, as the Lord directed; or if he had been Travelling on the High-way, and ſeeing Boys playing on the Firſt Day in the Summer-time, and their Barents or Old People ſitting beſides them, he would Preach to them, ſo that he was always concerned for God's Glory, and Truth's Praiſe, and Propagating of his Glorious Goſpel of Peace: He was a Man I
<pb facs="tcp:97179:14"/>loved when he was a Prieſt, and more abundantly when he was a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Preacher: He was a Comely Man of Perſon, Fair and Ruddy, his Hair Gray before he Died, being of a Good Old Age. I was at his Funeral in the Town of <hi>Stafford,</hi> where was divers Hundreds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and I was concerned in Teſtimony in the Lord's Power among them.

                  <p>THis ſhort Teſtimony is with me to give concerning <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> having good knowledge of him that he was a Man of a harmleſs Life and Converſation, in which he was a good Savour, his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation confirming his Doctrine, God had undoubtedly indued him with Patience, and had committed to him a Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, which he was both a Preacher of, and a great Sufferer for; his Patience in his Sufferings manifeſted his Chriſtianity, he never ſought his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by any indirect Means, but waited patiently till the Lord effected it, and when at Liberty he Travelled much abroad, and Laboured much for Truth's Proſperity; God that called him, did in all things fit him for that Work in which he imployed him, and his Labour therein was very Effectual, both for the Comforting and Eſtabliſhing thoſe already Convinced, as alſo for the Convincing of many, as many Living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that he hath left behind can Teſtifie, alſo the ſtopping of the Mouths of many Oppoſers: He had a Word of Counſel to the Weak and Feeble, and a ſharp Reprover of Diſobedient, Looſe-minded ones; he was altogether Accompliſhed for that Work whereunto his Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. And what ſhall I ſay, but that I have Dear Unity with that Spirit that he was acted by, and doth ſee him in that which is Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his Bow was always bent, and retained its ſtrength; his Arrows were ſharp, and often pierced the Uncircumciſed; and as one well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he miſt not his Mark; the Churches amongſt whom he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant wants him, for he was a Faithful Labourer in his Day, he ſought not his own, but others good, walking according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of him that called him, in which he was fervent and diligent, Preaching the Word both in Seaſon and out of Seaſon; and though he be taken from us as to Viſibility, yet his Life and Memory lives with
<pb facs="tcp:97179:15"/>us, ſeveral ſweet Expreſſions came from him in the time of his Illneſs, and was very ſweetly kept in that time of his Weakneſs; he lay ill not long, though for a conſiderable time an Indiſpoſition of Body did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, yet his Love and Good-will was ſuch to the Truth, that, as one ſtriving againſt his Diſtemper, he kept not his Chamber long, but went to Meetings, and viſited Friends, but at laſt it prevailed over him, and brought him to his Bed, where he Died the 18th of the Firſt Month 1681. in the Sixty-fifth Year of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a word, he was a Man of Peace; and as he Delighted in it, now is a Poſſeſſor of it, and of that Joy that is Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in which he lives with his God; a Poſſeſſor of that Bleſſedneſs and Reward, which through the ſame Faith and Patience, we that are yet behind, ſhall aſſuredly obtain as therein we keep, in the Lord's time. Many good things he wrote in his Day; if thou read this Book, thou wilt perceive and meet with good Exhortations in it, which will I hope tend to thy Strength and Incouragement.</p>

                  <head>A ſhort TESTIMONY Concerning that Faithful Servant of the Lord Thomas Taylor, Whoſe Memory is Bleſſed.</head>
                  <p>DEAR <hi>Tho Taylor</hi> he was a Man who loved the Truth with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Mind, and ſought the Honour thereof, and not himſelf: He was ready at all times to ſpeak a word for God, as there was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to inform the Minds of People, to that which would ſtand them in ſtead, when time here ſhall be no more: He was a very good Inſtrument amongſt us, and a bleſſed Example in his Converſation, which did beſpeak him to be the Servant of Chriſt Jeſus: He loved the Proſperity of Truth more than all other things whatſoever, and for that was he given up in Soul, Body and Spirit, to ſerve the Lord and his Generation Faithfully, Travelling from Place to Place for that end; and as he lived in the Truth, ſo he finiſhed his Teſtimony in the ſame. And though his Body be removed from us, and gone to the Earth from whence it came, yet his Spirit lives amongſt us, and his Life ſhall never die. Truly I am not without a living Sence upon my Spirit, what a Loſs we have of him amongſt us, (who was always ready to ſerve the Truth, and the leaſt in it,) and Sorrow is ready to ſeize upon me in the Conſideration thereof; yet when I conſider, that it is according to the Will of the Lord, I am therein well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, knowing that he hath this Advantage of us that are left behind <hi>(viz.)</hi> Is freed from Danger of falling into the Snares of this World,
<pb facs="tcp:97179:16"/>which we are liable to whilſt in this Body,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1658"/> except we keep in that which is only able to keep us whilſt we remain here: And I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Lord will raiſe up the ſame Life in others to Teſtifie to the ſame Truth which he lived in, and that the Teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall never fall: This is great Comfort to me, and all who love the Lord, to whom be living Praiſes, Honour, Glory and Obedience, given for ever and for ever more, from my living Soul, which he hath quickned to himſelf, by his Living Power, and Heavenly Life; to him I ſay be all the Glory given now and always. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Thomas Taylor</hi> your Brother and Companion in the Patience, Sufferings and Kingdom of Chriſt, unto you all ſendeth Greeting, and by the Spirit of the Lord God doth hereby give you all to underſtand, That it is the true Grace of God, and Power of Life, into which you are called, and which you have received, and wherein you ſtand, and whereby you are inlightned, and have been given to ſee the old dead way of Sin and Formality to avoid it; and the good and living way of Truth and Righteouſneſs in Spirit, to embrace and follow it to the Praiſe of our Holy Heavenly Father World without end: And this Grace of God that hath thus brought Salvation to us, and is our Teacher and Guide in the good Way, is the ſame that would teach all, and would have all Men to be Saved; and (to that purpoſe) hath appeared to all Men, to leave all without Excuſe. So Dear Hearts, all in the Light and Power of this Pure Truth of our God made manifeſt in us, dwell, and therein let every Soul bathe it ſelf, and drink thereof abundantly, and therewith be covered, that as an Helmet, Sword and Buckler, it may be unto all our Souls, againſt all Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So again, all Dear Hearts, Brethren and Siſters in the Covenant of Life, Children and Servants of the Moſt High God, in the Life and Strength of God, and his everlaſting Light of Truth, manifeſt, dwell and walk in it indeed, grow over all the World, and Powers of Darkneſs and Wickedneſs whatſoever, that the Seed of the Promiſe inheriting, and the Seed of the Serpent and Tranſgreſſion caſt out, you may indeed be true Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of, to the Glory of the Lord God, and Good of your precious Souls for ever: For he that Believes, and in the pure Faith truly waits, hath and knows the Witneſs in himſelf, (the Spirit) which he hath of God for his everlaſting Comforter; but the Witneſs of God, and his Face, is againſt him that doth Evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile: But the Love of God, and Glory to ſuch as continue Faithful and Patient in the Well doing bearing the Croſs, and enduring it to the End. And Bleſſed are all that keep the Commandments of Life, that they may witneſs a daily Acceſs and Freedom to the Tree of Life and Throne of Mercy, to feed thereon, and Live for ever: For now is the Life ariſen, and the true Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World appeared; and of his Fullneſs have all we received, even Grace for Grace; and his Commandments are not now to us Grievous, Praiſe to his Name for ever: And our Rock is not like the World's Rock, even many of themſelves already being Judges; all

So be ye wiſe in the diſpenſing and dealing out of your Heavenly Father's Treaſures which he hath betruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you withal, and made ye Stewards of for his Glory.

So we may daily ſee that the Contenders and vain Enquirers of this preſent time are of <hi>Herod</hi> and the Serpent's Race, who cannot endure to hear of the Birth of that Seed that is above every other Seed, and is King of the true <hi>Jews</hi> in Spirit, and to whom all the Fleſhly Births, under what Name or Profeſſion ſoever, muſt be ſubjected and bow: And as the love of the Lord doth indeed conſtrain us as freely and abundantly to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of our Heavenly Treaſure to the pure in Heart, who hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, as we have received them, even ſo doth the ſame Love and the Wiſdom thereof engage us to do as our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father doth, who hides the things of his Kingdom from the Serpent's Seed, the Wiſe and Prudent of the World, and ſo the Croſs is the ſafe way; and ſo, as we ſtand in the Croſs, our preaching is to the <hi>Jew</hi> outward a ſtumbling-block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs, as in former Times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And ſo in all our Diſputings and Reaſoning with the World about the Things of God's Kingdom, we muſt mind the Croſs, leſt for want of a Hedge, the wild Boar of the Forreſt get in and hurt the tender Plants of God. Friends, ſtrive not in your Wills for Victory, but wait in the Light to feel the Spiritual Weapon, the ſharp Two-edged Sword of the Spirit of God to cut down the Adverſary. There came one to Chriſt and ſaid, <hi>Are there few that ſhall be ſaved?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Strive thou to enter in at the ſtrait Gate;</hi> ſo his Anſwer was in the Croſs, and he minded more the Edification of the Man's Soul, than to pleaſe the buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body's curious Mind; ſo we muſt dwell in his Wiſdom, and that will lead into Chriſt's Work. Another asked him, <hi>What he muſt do to enter into Life?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>What readeſt thou?</hi> So to ſuch as profeſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be their Rule, or ſo to bring them to the Obedience and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Rule; and if they cannot believe Scripture, which they acknowledge to be true, how can they believe our words whom they look upon to be as Hereticks and Deceivers. <hi>The Servant of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>muſt not ſtrive, but in Meekneſs inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves to the Truth, muſt ſeek to bring them to the Truth, that thereby they may be delivered out of the Snares of Satan, whom their Ignorance are led Captive by him at his Will.</hi> Now, the Servant of God in this weighty Matter may conſider what manner of Oppoſers theſe are, whether they ſtand in a lower or higher place of wickedneſs; for ſome are wicked in a high meaſure, who <hi>will neither enter into the Kingdom of God themſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97179:22"/>nor ſuffer others;</hi> as <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.9, 10. who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeking to draw <hi>the Deputy from the Faith.</hi> Theſe may be more ſeverely reproved, as was thereby the Apoſtle, but ſtill with this Cantion, that all be done by the pure Sword of God's Spirit, and not by the Wrath of Man; for the Wrath of Man works not the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God: And ſuch Oppoſers as this had Chriſt to do withal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he pronounced ſo many Woes, declaring their wicked Root, by calling them Vipers and Serpents, and Children of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. throughout, and <hi>John</hi> 8.44. But to others who are not ſo high and ſtrong in their Wickedneſs, much Wiſdom, Tenderneſs and Patience muſt be uſed, that if God may at any time give them Repentance, that from the Darkneſs to the Light of God they may be turned, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference, and others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the Fire, hating even the Garments ſpotted by the Fleſh.</hi> And all my Dear Friends in Chriſt Jeſus, who are at any time called forth by the Power of the Lord God, to Encounter your Spiritual Adverſaries, the Diſputers of this World, who <hi>Goliah</hi> like, are ſo wiſe and ſtrong in their own Conceit, and have ſo armed themſelves with their Carnal Weapons, that they are not afraid to defie <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea, <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s God: I ſay, keep in the Power of God, and truſt not to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour, but wait to feel the little Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands, to hit the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Forehead, and to bruiſe his Head, and to ſtrike at his Feet, that the falſe Foundation whereon he ſtandeth may be removed, and ſo the Image may fall into nothing at once: And in this great Buſineſs, (to wit, the Lord's Controverſie) my Friends, always mind your own Standing and Foundation, to keep cloſe to it, and not to be driven from it by any means, for the Enemy will ſeek to draw you from your ſure Ground, the meaſure of Life and Experienced Truth in you, into vain Janglings and fruitleſs Diſputes, to gratifie their Corrupt Minds, wherein is no Edification to the Soul, which the Servant of God muſt wait in all things to edifie; and though for our Work herein we may be accounted as Fools by the World, who cannot judge but by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance of things, yet with God ſhall we be accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Doers of his Will, and our Jay in his Sight and Preſence ſhall abide, and none ſhall take it from us, as thus we abide in God's Will, Work and Covenant, who is over all Bleſſed for Evermore.</p>
                     <p>And Friends, of Scorners we muſt beware, for their Root is Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, and their Ground Accurſed, and the good Seed in them hath no place to grow.</p>
                     <p>And of ſuch as Profeſſing Scripture, and Wiſdom, and neither can nor will believe that Chriſt lighteth every Man that cometh into the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97179:23"/>World with ſufficient Grace or Light, though <hi>John</hi> ſaith expreſly, That <hi>in the Word</hi> (Chriſt Jeſus) <hi>was Life, and that Life is the Light of Men, and the Light</hi> of that Life <hi>ſhineth in Darkneſs,</hi> (to wit in Men) <hi>lighting every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> and that ſuch as received him in that his Appearance, <hi>to them he gave Power to become Sons of God, John</hi> the firſt Chapter. I ſay of theſe Unbelievers before-mentioned, it may be truly ſaid they are Children of Darkneſs, and ſo much is not to be ſaid to them, but even to bring them to Chriſt's Light in them, to know it, and learn of it, for till then they will never underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ſuch Profeſſors as have been long Reading Scripture, and have heard the like Teſtimony of the Kingdom of God from the Spirit of God in his Servants in theſe Days, and yet plead for outward Shadows and Sounds, and things that periſh with them, to be the Way and Means of the Kingdom, and are Ignorant of the Myſtery of it in Man, and ſo deny the Word and Power of God nigh in the Heart; and yet in this their Darkneſs ſeparate themſelves in Profeſſion from others, thinking themſelves to be ſomething when indeed they are nothing; theſe are to be turned away from and judged.</p>
                     <p>As alſo ſuch as deny ſinleſs Perfection, and ſo know not the Birth of God in Man, but will plead for Sin, yea, in the Regenerate, during term of Life, as though Chriſt were a Miniſter of Sin, and could make nothing perfect like the weak Figures of the Law. Though the Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>The Birth of God ſins not,</hi> and <hi>he that abides in Chriſt ſinneth not,</hi> and <hi>that Chriſt the better Hope makes perfect.</hi> See <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.19. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>Now the Reaſon why the Law could make nothing perfect, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not take away Sin, and ſo that Perfection that is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is no Perfection at all; therefore it's ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt by One-offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. And <hi>behold the Lamb of God that takes away the Sin of the World.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>MY Dear Friends in Chriſt Jeſus, who are Faithful in God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Light and Life, to dwell, grow and increaſe; yea, and to bring forth Fruit of Righteouſneſs to God's Glory abundantly, my true and tender Love ſalutes you all, and my Spirit in God rejoyceth becauſe of you all, and I cannot but evermore, upon every remembrance of you, Praiſe, Laud and Magnifie the great and glorious Name of our Heavenly Father, for his tender Love and tender Mercy to you all, and for the Power of his Love in Chriſt, whereby he hath reached help to your Souls in the needful time, when all help of Creatures was at an end; and hath raiſed you up from the Dead, to be his living Witneſſes in the Day of his Love to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and hath choſen you for his People, and to bear the Name of Sons and Daughters, Servants and Hand-maids in his Houſe, to do his Service, and to bear his Name in Righteouſneſs before the Children of Men. O my Soul is even filled with the ſweet heavenly Vertue of this Love of God upon every Remembrance of you, even of you all, and every Member of the Holy Body of Jeſus Chriſt in every place: For who can expreſs the Beauty of your Life, and Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Treaſure which you poſſeſs in his Love? O Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath choſen us, and ſet his pure Love upon us, whereby it comes to paſs, that we are more than Conquerors over all the things of Darkneſs, and Powers of Evil, that would ſeparate us from his pure Love. O Glory, Glory to his great Name, who by his pure Love hath begotten us again from the Dead, into the Image of his living, pure and holy Nature of Love, to love one another, and to reach forth pure Love in Spirit and Truth unto all; yea, unto Enemies, for at the Birth of Jeſus this was ſounded forth by the Heavenly, even <hi>Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men.</hi> So that when Men have us, and ſpeak Evil of us, we know they have no Cauſe for it; for if they know our Love and good Will to them, they would love us, and much more the Father of our precious Life, by whom we are begotten into ſuch a pure heavenly Love, as even labours and travels night and day how we may fulfil that great Service of Love, and continual Duty of good Will, that we owe to the whole Creation of God: For Oh how great is the Bondage of a great part of it, as yet being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97179:25"/>ſo burdened with the weight of Corruption that lyes upon it, that it ever cries unto God by reaſon of Oppreſſion, and waits for the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation and Enjoyment of the pure and holy Liberty of the Sons of God, wherein God alone may be glorified, and the Creature ſet free to run in the ways of his Commandments with Joy, and the wicked one may be put under into the Pit of everlaſting Woe, there to remain for ever. So my Dear Friends and Fellow-Citizens of the New and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ye True and Faithful Seed and Servants of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living and true God, do you rejoyce and lift up your Heads, for from the eternal Fountain of Life and Love is your Salvation come, your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upon a Fat and Fruitful Land, not as <hi>Egypt</hi> watered by Mortal Man, but as the Promiſed Land watered from Heaven, and made to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all Lands in Goodneſs and Fruitfulneſs; yea, I know you Faithful ones are able to read in the Myſtery where the Fullneſs of all is enjoyed, and all Barrenneſs and Diſappointment done away. So my Dear Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Members in the Heavenly Body and Faithful Branches of the living Vine, do you rejoyce and lift up your tender Souls in God's Name, and in his living Mercies at all times; truſt, truſt not in any thing, but in the Name and merciful Power of the ever-living God our tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in this Faith will be your Victory in all things; by this Faith will your Hearts be kept clean to God alone, out of all Defilements and Worldly Intanglements whatſoever; yea, and by this Faith will you be kept ſo continually a top of all Powers of Darkneſs and Spiritual Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs whatſoever, that in Freedom of Mind, and Joy of Heart, you may offer your ſelves to your Maker and Redeemer as a reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and pure Offering of Obedience to his Praiſe, as is due for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>So my Beloved, in God's pure and precious Truth, I am your Brother and Fellow-Sufferer for the Elections ſake, well ſatisfied in this through the unerring Spirit, that as we abide Faithful to God in our Conditions, we ſhall never want the Support, Joy and Comfort, and daily Supply of his abundant Love, and all-ſufficient Grace; ſo that we need not fear the Terrors of the Night, nor noyſom Plagues that deſtroys at Noon-day, nor the Doing of Mortal Men, becauſe the Lord is become our ſure and ſafe Hiding-place, and Caſtle of Defence, as he was to our Brethren in the Faith in all fore-going Ages. And what if they ſay, That we are a Poor Deceived and Contemptible People, it matters not, ſeeing we have God's certain Truth in us, the Foundation of our Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and God's gracious Acceptance of us in Chriſt for our Strength and Glory? And what if Mens Decrees be againſt the Liberty of our Holy and Spiritual Worſhip? We muſt not be diſmay'd for ſuch things, for ſo it was in the days of his Fleſh, who ſaid, <hi>The Servant is not greater
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97179:25"/>than his Lord;</hi> and he endured ſuch Contradictions againſt himſelf for our ſakes; and he beheld his Father's Power, and in it ſtood to the overcoming of all Enemies; and ſo hath given a good Example what to do in Times of Trouble, and whither to go in Times of Need; for he that hath promiſed is near to all that fly to him for Succour who both hath, and daily doth make fully manifeſt his Kindneſs and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in us, and for us, that we might be to him a People, and he to us a God for evermore. So into the Arms of his eternal Power, and Bowels of everlaſting Love, I commend you all, to be kept, comforted and carried over all that would hurt you, or hinder you from walking in his good Way; and reſts your dear and tender loving Brother, in the Patience and Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as Bound, yet Free, Glory to his Name everlaſting. So be it, even Amen, <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> Praiſe the Lord, ſaith my Spirit, in the Unity of your precious Life, which we have in his Love.</p>

And now, Dear Friends, ſeeing God hath been ſo gracious to us above all the People of the Earth, as to ſet his Name upon us in Righteouſneſs, to the Amazement and Aſtoniſhment of many, and hath cauſed our Rod that was dry (even as others) to flouriſh and bear Fruits in the midſt of the Earth, to the Praiſe of his Living Power, as a Token of his Acceptance and Choice: And ſeeing God hath ſo graciouſly performed his Promiſes to us his Seed, made to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old, in bringing up our Souls from Death, and our Life from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Sword, and hath unlooſed our Tongues to ſpeak of his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the great Congregation; why ſhall we not then ſpeak good of this the Name of our God, the true Everliving God, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom the whole World, with their many Idols, Gods and Lords are nothing? We may not be hindred by the Adverſary from breathing forth our pure Life given us of God for his Glory, in a continual men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Holineſs; for if we ſhould be ſilent, the very Stones would do it; for now is the Lord Jeſus ariſen indeed, and aſcended far above all Heavens, Principalities, Powers, Names, and Greatneſſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and come again to our Spirits, according to his Bleſſed Promiſe, that of his unſpeakable Fulneſs we might all partake in abundance, to the cauſing of our Cup to overflow with all Holy and Heavenly Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Praiſes, for the perfect Salvation of our God, to the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every tender holy Plant in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that waits for the ſame.

And ſo you, my Dear Friends, and much longed after in the Lord, when I conſider the many Tryals, and great Contradiction of Sinners of all ſorts, which for the Love and Zeal of our Holy Lord God, and his unchangeable Truth, you have endured from the beginning, my Heart is greatly affected with the Glory, and cannot but Praiſe the Lord for you, that you are even become as a Bullwark of his Truth, in the midſt of a crooked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and Back-ſliding Nation, who though like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, they look with Faces ſeveral ways, yet in Heart are one, every one with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and Stings in their Tails like Scorpions, to do Miſchief, by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the bad part in People, againſt the Simplicity of the Goſpel of Love, and Life of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which would gather, unite and heal all of all their Soul-Maladies for ever, if they did not make themſelves unworthy of.

And on the other, when I ſee the little Horn, with a Countenance more ſtout than his Fellows, in his very Words of Reproach, and Work of Scattering, tell of your Scattering whom God hath gathered, I cannot but ſay, O Lord Bleſs thy People (whom thou haſt ſo powerfully delivered) and govern and keep their Hearts in perfect Peace with thee, through all and over all, even as thou doſt this day, for ever and ever, that many may come to the Brightneſs of our day, and Glory of our Kingdom, which is not of this World, but of God eternal our Father, who is over all Bleſſed for ever.

                     <p>Further, Oh all People!

I ſay, that it hath been an old Cuſtom of ſuch Wolves to Murther Souls and People of God; for in ſome Scriptures is mention made of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and in others of the Bodily Murther, that they had, and would be guilty of. And further take notice, that theſe Banding Prieſts are a lewd Generation; which, in other Expreſſions, is all one as to ſay, <hi>Thieves, Whores</hi> and <hi>Harlots;</hi> and ſo indeed they are alſo in Scripture uſually ſaid to be; and therefore Typed, and ſet forth under the name of Painted Whoriſh <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and the Well-favoured, <hi>Harlot;</hi> and here, under the Similitude of Troops of Robbers, waiting for a Man; and <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, <hi>Miniſters of Satan, having a form of Godlineſs, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſiſting the Power and Truth of Godlineſs:</hi> And therefore (Oh all People!) you are Exhorted by the Spirit of Truth, to turn away from them; yea, and commanded to come out from amongſt them, upon pain of <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> Jer. 23. throughout. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. throughout. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12, 13, 15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97179:36"/>of a Chapter, according to their Wills, for filthy Lucre, and calls it their Text, and from it draws Doctrines, and Reaſons, and Uſes, as they call them, ask them whether there be any ſuch Company of Falſe Teachers now-a-days in <hi>England</hi> to be found, as this Scripture ſpeaks of, who <hi>as Troops of Robbers wait for a Man, ſo wait to Murther in the way by conſent:</hi> And who they are, and what, and who they Murther; and with what they Murther; and how theſe Murtherers may be known; what be their Fruits, <hi>For by their Fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And ask them further, Whether theſe Falſe Teachers, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea</hi> here calls lewd Murtherers, be not the ſame in Nature with thoſe which <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the 56. Chap. and 10 v. of his Propheſie, calls greedy dumb Dogs, that ſought their Gain from their quarter, and could never have enough: And the ſame that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpoke of in Chap. 5. ver. 1, 2. &amp; 23. Chap. of his Propheſie throughout, <hi>That ſtole the word from their Neighbour, and uſed their Tongue, and ſaid, he ſaith, when the Lord never ſent them, and ſo could not profit the People at all.</hi> And whether they be not the ſame that <hi>Micah</hi> the Prophet (<hi>Mic.</hi> 3 5, &amp;c.) ſpeaks of, who <hi>preached for Hire, and divined for Money, and ſpake Peace to the Wicked for the Gift ſake, but if any put not into their Mouths, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared War againſt them,</hi> and yet like all Hypocrites would lean upon the Lord in words, and ſay, <hi>Is not the Lord amongſt us? No Evil ſhall come unto us.</hi> And whether theſe murtherous Prieſts were not one with thoſe that Chriſt Jeſus cried Woe againſt in <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>Who were Sayers, and not Doers; who loved to be called of Men Maſter, and bound heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon the People, and touched them not with one of their own Fingers, but ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, and would neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer others.</hi> And finally, ask them whether ſuch Men now, as ſtand over the People for Teachers, though under another Name, and making another Profeſſion in words, yet if they be found in the foreſaid ſteps, doing the foreſaid Deeds of thoſe forementioned Falſe Teachers, are not to receive the ſame Judgment, and to be cried againſt and denied, and forſaken by all the Children of Light now, as formerly, Yea or Nay.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Hoſea,</hi> thou Holy Prophet of God, thou haſt ſaid and laid down theſe two Doctrines or high Charges againſt the People in general, and againſt the Prieſts in particular: The firſt, <hi>That the People in general are polluted with Blood.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That as Troops of Robbers wait for a Man, ſo the company of Prieſts Murther in the way by Conſent.</hi> How doſt thou prove and make theſe good, for the <hi>Gileadites</hi> are deeply concerned in it; and they will have thee to make it good, or ſuffer for default? Yea, by the Spirit I make it good, thus: Gilead <hi>is a City polluted with Blood, becauſe they are ſuch as work Iniquity; and the Prieſts Murther in the

But <hi>Hoſea,</hi> thou muſt not be tried <hi>per pares,</hi> that is, them of like Condition or Quality with thee, to wit, the Holy Prophets and Children of God, who are Witneſſes with thee againſt the Abominations of their Times, and Sins that rules in Prieſts and People, for that will not ſatisfie nor ſerve the <hi>Gil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And theſe Men (the Grand Jury) muſt bring in their Verdict (as they call it) againſt thee, for they have found thee Guilty, (for thou haſt nothing on thy ſide but plain Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Man's Teſtimony, or an Oath) and the Judge of the Court (one of the chief Men among the <hi>Gileadites</hi> that is verſed in Law-matters) thinks it fit thou ſhould be fined to pay a Sum of Money for thy Offence, (Oh Prophet! thou Man of God!) and be kept in Priſon (Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that matters not) until thou pay it: But what (Oh Prophet!) if thou haſt neither liberty in thy Spirit, nor outward Ability to pay thy Fine, What courſe muſt be taken with thee? Well, for that (O Prophet!) <hi>Gilead</hi> matters not, but impriſoned thou muſt remain, for ſo <hi>Gilead</hi> will be quit of thee, and thou cannot come into their Synagogues, Markets, nor other Aſſemblies, to cry againſt their Sins, and diſturb them, for the People and Prieſts would live quietly in their Sins, and they would not be diſturbed neither in the time of their Service, nor otherwiſe.

O! for that they matter not, for they are as careleſs over their own Members, them of their own polluted Church, (who divers of them are left in Priſon upon other accounts) as well as over thee. And ſo unleſs thou be provided for otherwiſe, thou mayſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there in Miſery and Want, or Periſh there as well as they, for any Care they will have of thee, for thou muſt not look that they that hate their own Fleſh can love thine. But the Righteous cannot be forſaken, for their Keeper is the Lord God of Truth and Love. So (O Prophet) be content, and wait in the Will of God in thy Condition; for, <hi>Bleſſed are they that Suffer for Righteouſneſs ſake;</hi> and the Scripture muſt be fulfilled which ſaith, <hi>They ſhall hawl you out of their Synagogues, and many other ways evil intreat you; yea, ſome of you they ſhall put to Death, and think therein they do God Service:</hi> And ſo wait to ſee the Sins of <hi>Gilead</hi> full; and then in the Judgment ſhalt thou, O Prophet of God, and all thy Suffering Brethren, rejoyce, and all the Workers of Iniquity be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, with all that Thirſt for Blood; and into the Holy City ſhall none ſuch enter; but the pure in Heart, who have come through the great Tribulation, and have waſhed their Garments white in the Blood of the Lamb, ſhall only enter, and alone inherit, to the Glory of the eternal righteous God for evermore; to whom all Honour and Glory is due, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>And now for the Uſe of theſe Doctrines, oh Prieſts and People, that make a Trade of talking of the Scripture of Truth, and Uſes from it, now and then in your high Places, but make none of walking in the Truth in your daily Converſation, it is to let you ſee, <hi>That there were Wolves in Sheeps Clothing formerly, and ſo to find ſuch now, is no new or ſtrange thing.</hi> And, <hi>That under a Profeſſion of God, People may be found Workers of Iniquity, and full of Blood.</hi> And, <hi>That a whoriſh Spirit, in a Teacher, is a murtherous Spirit, and will draw others from God into Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Death, and ſo by all means to be taken heed of.</hi> And it is to let

And what was ſaid by me, either in Steeple-houſe or out of it, at that time they hawled me to Priſon, I was there ready (as was offered) in the face of the open Court and Country, to make good by Scripture, both for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Manner, if liberty had been granted me; but they liked better to proceed by their own Law than that: And ſo laſt of all, him called the Judge of Aſſize, inſtead of puniſhing Offenders who had wronged me, he fined me [the Offended] five Marks, and Impriſonment until I ſhould pay it: And ſo becauſe I cannot give them Money for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Proceedings againſt me, and unchriſtian Dealings with me, I am kept here accordingly in the common Goal a Priſoner, yet free, and in that everlaſting Truth of God which cannot be bound, but tramples upon the Neck and Head of all Deceit more than a Conquerour. But from hence all that have Eyes, may ſee what little liberty Truth can yet get in the Earth, after ſo much War and words proteſted for it: And therefore whoever thou art that reads theſe things, know, that in <hi>England</hi> alſo now, if thou wilt live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, thou muſt ſuffer Perſecution; for the Scripture cannot be broken. And this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution now in <hi>England,</hi> ariſeth mainly from the blind Zeal that many have for keeping up their Miniſters, as they call them, from being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto in the Aſſembly, either in, after, or before the time of their Preaching, eſpecially on the firſt day of the Week, by them called the Lord's day, and Sabbath day, and this the People are prompted unto by the wicked Spirit in their Teachers, which cannot endure the Light that God hath raiſed up in his People in theſe Iſlands in theſe days: And ſo this is the Condemnation of all ſuch Children of Darkneſs, whether

Thou art that Finite One that ſtands againſt His Infiniteneſs, and glories in thy old uncircumciſed Heart; but His Infinite Light has comprehended thee, and doth and will Judge thee for thy Evil Work, and Blaſphemous Thoughts of Him, whom the Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens, cannot contain; but thou would'ſt limit His limitleſs Nature to a creatural Form like thy ſelf, as the Wicked do who know him not. And ſo of that Beaſt and myſterious <hi>Babylon</hi> thou art, who this day, with their many Heads, and Horns, and Forms of Falſe Knowledge, and Worſhips, and Churches, ſo called, do all, with one Conſent, puſh and fight againſt the Lamb, the Light and Son of the Incomprehenſible and Infinite Father, and his Faithful Followers; but the Lamb both hath and ever ſhall have the Victory, and the Mouth of all Iniquity ſhall be ſtopped, ſaith my Soul. And ſo well had it been for thee, if thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Faithful amongſt us, but a Wanderer and Unfaithful in Heart haſt thou been many a day; and ſo the Whore that watched in the Evening for the unwary young Man, hath caught thee in her Net, and there thou art a Slave in the Bands of Darkneſs, to the great Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy poor impriſoned Soul.</p>

You have not ſuffered your Minds and Souls to be guided by the pure Light of Jeſus Chriſt that hath Viſited you in great Love in theſe Days, but have rather choſen to follow your own Thoughts and wrong Expoſitions of Scripture to your great hurt; And, becauſe you have Preached and Profeſſed that waſhing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Water is the only Gate in the Chriſtian Fellowſhip, you are both to looſe your Credit amongſt Men, by owning the more Excellent and Everlaſting Way, though it be moſt plainly declared, and by the Spirit demonſtrated to you in theſe Days: And ſo you go about to Eſtabliſh that which makes nothing perfect, in Oppoſition to the Power of God which only makes Perfect. And ſo you reſemble them of old, who ſtuck in the Shadows of the Law, in Oppoſition to him that was the End of the Law, and came to fulfil it; <hi>Chriſt Jeſus over all God Bleſſed for ever.</hi> And ſo if I could have found in you a true Deſire after God's Kingdom, may be I might have gotten a little Liberty to have Reaſoned with you at this time of the things thereof: But ſeeing there hath been ſo many Endeavours and Deſires in us after your Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good, and ye will not come to Chriſt to know him in you, that you may have Life; for this time I thus reſt in Peace with my God the Righteous Judge, believing, that in his own Way and Time, he will Silence every Tongue that moves againſt his Bleſſed Truth (the Light) and thoſe that love it and follow it in the Regeneration in this Day of his Power, wherein the willing People are brought up, through the Death of the Fleſh, to ſerve the Lord in the Land of the Living, in new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as our Souls do this Day, ever Praiſed be his Name, the Arm of his Holineſs, for it is worthy.</p>

                  <p>And now, where is the Diſputer of this World, who pleads for ſeen things which Quicken not the Souls, and will not have the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, who is the Reſurrection of the Life, to Rule in them; but are glad when they can get any thing ſeemingly that makes for them in their periſhing Way? But our Work is, Praiſed be God to hold the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints in a pure Conſcience, and in the Ability that God giveth us to help to bring People to God, where is the true Reſt for ever: And thoſe that will not ſubmit their Minds, Hearts and Souls to the Light of the Eternal Word which is nigh in the Heart, ſhall never be Eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs and Peace, but ſhall weary themſelves in the very Fires for Vanity; and this we have Learned through many Tribulations, Bleſſed be God for his Unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gift; and ſo if you be Wiſe, be Wiſe for your Souls, and Learn with us to ſit in Silence at Jeſus Feet, to know what he requires of you, and ceaſe your running and doing without him, for you have ſpent too much time in Vain already, ſeeing the Spirit of the World is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen in you; Reſts your Souls Friend, and a Lover of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, being become a willing Sufferer for the Holy Seeds Sake.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you, or ſome of you, ſeem Offended that Widdow <hi>Cock</hi> hath left you, and come amongſt us, and ſay, ſhe hath done it, and yet given you no ſufficient Reaſon and Satisfaction for her ſo doing, I ſay, that Reaſon, I ſuppoſe, ſhe hath ſhown ſufficient to ſome of you, but to give Satisfaction to you in it that is hard, ſeeing you Speak Evil of the Good Way of God which ſhe hath taſted of amongſt us; for, of a Truth, the Lord and his Power and Preſence is with us, Bleſſed be his Name for ever: And ſhe ſtayed too long upon the barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains where your Flocks Feed.</p>

What a Cry this hath, and will have, in the Ears of God, it concerns thee deeply to conſider, for he is well known not to with-hold Right from any where it is due: But though his Sufferings for time be long, yet thine, if thou repent not, will be very much longer; for it is a very fearful thing for thee, thus in thy Sins, to fall into the Hands of the Living God. So whilſt thou haſt time prize it, and ſay not within thy ſelf, that thou ſhalt have Peace, though thou continue in this thy Hard-heartedneſs, for certainly there is no Peace from the Holy, Juſt and Merciful God, to any abiding in the Paths thou walkeſt in.

                  <p>ALL ſimple-hearted People, who have any thing of the true Fear of God moving upon your Hearts, and whoſe Deſires are in any meaſure purely after God and Goodneſs, and are not altogether hardned againſt the Lord, and Good of your Souls: Conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little, and unbethink you well, as in the Preſence of God, what hath been from time to time declared to you, and all People, out of the Priſon-Window: Hath not the Witneſs of God, in his Servant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared amongſt you, the Dreadful Day of the Lord God, which will aſſuredly come upon all the Wicked, and ſuch as are covered, and not with the Spirit of the Lord, whether Prieſts or People: And hath not the ſame Voice, in great Love and Tenderneſs, freely proclaimed Peace and Good Will to the Penitent; and the moſt acceptable Day of the Lord to the Broken-hearted, and ſuch as Mourn under the Senſe of Sin, and Burthen of Unrighteouſneſs, without reſpect of Perſons: And are not theſe things to be laid to Heart, and not at all to be ſlighted? And therefore I ſay unto you, O People, even you that love your Souls, and are not yet come to the true Reſt, Chriſt Jeſus in Spirit, but are wandering from Mountain to Hill, after the Hireling-Teachers, one day after another, and yet are not ſatisfied with their empty Words, but are dead, dry and barren in Heart, as to the Power of Godlineſs, after all your Money ſpent and Labour taken: I ſaid, Is not this an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sign, that it is not Bread that hath by them been miniſtred to you, but the Chaff of Mens Inventions: For ſaith the Lord, <hi>Does not my words do good to them that deſire after me?</hi> But alas People, the Hireling's Words which he ſells you for Money, are not the Word of God, but only what he hath gathered and conceived from the Letter of another Man's Line, and ſo cannot profit you, though you ſhould hear never ſo much of it, no more than Chaff can feed: And ſo do not ſay the Fault is not in our Teachers, but only in us: For I ſay unto you in the Spirit of Truth, the Fault is now in you both, for the Day of God is dawned, and now you are both warned, and ſo are left both without Excuſe. There was a Time of Darkneſs and Ignorance which God winked at, but now the Life is manifeſt, and the true Light that enlightens being broken forth through the Clouds, you are hereby warned, and all every where exhorted, to Repent. So harken to the meaſure of that Light that ſhines in your dark Hearts, which convinceth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97179:49"/>you of Sin and Unbelief, and would lead you from them, this is the Word of the Spirit of God that is nigh you where-ever you are, and from whoſe ſight you can hide nothing, though never ſo ſecret. Here is your Guide to God and Life eternal if you love it, and here is the Door that ſhuts you out from God and his Glory if you hate it; ſo prize your time, and while you have time, learn to know this Light of Chriſt in your Conſciences to be your Teacher and only Guide, For why will ye die, why ceaſe you not from Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, that broken Ciſtern? Time will come when Fools will wiſh they had been wiſer, and when God's Witneſs will be remembred, and when ſuch as now Suffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, will be had in Honour. Reſts, as always, your Friend</p>

And verily the Lord is ariſing in mighty Power to Judge the World by Jeſus Chriſt whom ye have Crucified, and whoſe Counſels you have ſet at naught, and have choſen rather to follow the Hireling-Teacher, and his ways, than the way of the Lord God. So conſider what is here ſaid, and run not head-long to your own Deſtruction, for what account can ye give to a pure God, in the day of his fierce Wrath, who are not yet at all cleanſed from your Unrighteouſneſs; Will your crying <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> Save ye, who are found doing your own Wills and ſatisfying your own Luſhs, without Repentance.

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is in my Heart, as from the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, to warn thee to ſtop the Current of that grievous Perſecution which is raiſed up againſt us, the Harmleſs People of God, in Scorn called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> for our pure Conſcience ſake at this day: For of a Truth the Lord God hath raiſed us up in his eternal Love to be his People, to bear his Name in Righteouſneſs before the Children of Men, and ſo to exerciſe our Conſciences in a pure Love and true Good Will towards God and all Men as he hath taught us, and doth teach all that come to him: And therefore weigh things well in thy Heart, in the cool of the day, and be not a means of injuring us for this the Exerciſe of our pure Conſcience, for truly the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is highly diſpleaſed already for what is done againſt us. O conſider, conſider, Doth not his Holy Eye behold, and his Heavenly Heart conſider, the great Wrongs that are daily done us for his Names ſake, our Bodies impriſoned, our Eſtates ſpoiled, our Meeting-houſes pulled down; yea, whole Families ruined, as to the outward World, for no other cauſe, but becauſe we cannot ceaſe to meet together in his Name as he requires us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his, in a moſt harmleſs and peaceable manner, as his People in former Ages did, and as we have always done, ſince we were to God a People. And never let it be ſaid, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Second diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Good People of the Land, under his Government, of their Expectations; for behold we looked for the Continuance of Good Things from thee, becauſe of ſome words paſſed out of thy Mouth, but behold great Evil hath enſued. O let not the Evil Counſel of thy own Heart, or of others, cauſe thee to go on in that which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring God's Judgments upon thy Soul and Body, and the whole Nation, if it be perſiſted in, as this preſent undertaking againſt us will do. We deſire not your Ruin no more than our own, but this we know certainly, and the Scripture of Truth abundantly witneſſes it, That never did any Proſper, who did, or ſuffered to be done, ſo great Injury, againſt a Harmleſs and Innocent People, as we are known to God to be. O let not the King believe any longer, the vain and falſe Suggeſtions of evil Men againſt us. If we had had any Mind againſt the King's Welfare, we ſhould not have had that Boldneſs that we have in God's ſight and thine; but now knowing in our Conſciences, that all our Endeavours have been from the beginning, how to glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherein we can, with Safety of our Conſcience to Chriſt, we do obey you; but wherein we cannot, is it not your Wiſdom to bear with us, as your ſelves in the like caſe would be done by? And ſo fulfil the Royal Law indeed, which ſaith, <hi>As you would that Men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do unto them.</hi> And this is a Law worthy a King to meditate in night and day, and not to follow the Counſel that is contrary: And this is a Foundation which all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments and Councils ought to build upon, or otherwiſe how is it poſſible their Houſe ſhould continue; for from the height of Heaven hath the Lord beheld the Afflictions and Oppreſſions, and heard the Groans and Cries of the Innocent Sufferers in <hi>England</hi> this day, and will certainly deliver thoſe that wait for him: But I would not have the King to be an Object of God's Wrath in that day if poſſible. And therefore in the Name of the Lord God, am I thus moved to write unto thee, and lay theſe things before thee, deſiring that thou maiſt read them, and well weigh them, for they are of greateſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that, which rightly made uſe of, tends not only to thy Well-being in this World, but alſo to the Eternal Good of thy Soul Reſts God's Servant, and thy Soul and the Nations Friend,</p>

And firſt, let <hi>Haman,</hi> one of the great Informers come into your Mind, and conſider his Work and End, a woful Work did he work againſt his own Soul, in his Informing and Incenſing the King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe honeſt hearted <hi>Mordecai</hi> could not bow to his Pride, as the Heathen did; and ſee his End, and tremble ye when ye read the Hiſtory of the Matter, as at large you may in the Book of <hi>Eſther.</hi>

                  <head>Some Serious Conſiderations concerning the Prieſts of the High Places, called Churches,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1679"/> their Sprinkling Infants, Marrying People, and Burying their Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. IN their Sprinkling they abuſe, and miſerably wreſt Scripture to prove their Practice: For that Scripture, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaks not a word of Sprinkling them, much leſs of their Doings and Doctrines about it. And for that Scripture, <hi>Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. it is nothing at all for them neither: For it is certain, the Spirit of God both can and hath, and daily doth Regenerate People without outward Water; but the Water without the Spirit never did, nor never can Regenerate any, and how the Spirit cometh to the Inſenſible Infants (that by their own Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot act Faith) or whether it come to them at all in or by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theirs, I am ſure they cannot tell, neither have they any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Ground to ſay or think it doth, ſeeing there is no Command nor Promiſe at all, in all the Scripture for it, upon ſuch their Doings, upon ſuch Subjects, unleſs they will ſay with the groſs Papiſts, that Grace is conferred upon People, <hi>ex opere operato, viz.</hi> by the Prieſts meer doing about them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They commit another great Evil in this Matter in bringing in People to promiſe that for the little Children which they neither do, nor (of themſelves) never can do; nay, which they have not Faith ſo much as to believe that ever any can do by any means, whilſt they are upon the Earth; to wit, to <hi>forſake the Devil and all his Works,</hi> &amp;c. which is manifeſt by their denial of ſinleſs Perfection, ſince all Sin is the Devil's Work: And after the old Popiſh manner calling them God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers, ſo taking God's Name in vain; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while calling them Sureties, ſo taking Chriſt's Office from him, who is the alone Surety, Mediator and Advocate between God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In their great Blindneſs and Preſumption, calling upon the People to give God Thanks with them, for that he hath Regenerated, as they ſay, the Infant or Infants then under their hands by ſuch doings; though as I ſaid, they have neither Precept nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for it, nor Manifeſtation from God then upon the Child, for their ſo believing and concluding. And ſo for their manifold taking God's
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97179:51"/>Name thus in vain, and cauſing you their Followers to do ſo alſo, how ſhall they be held Guiltleſs: For, ſaith God, <hi>I will not hold them Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that take my Name in vain.</hi> And how can theſe Prieſts blame the blind Papiſts for their fooliſh Doctrine of waſhing away Original Sin by their Baby Baptiſm, when they by the like doing proclaim Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven to ſuch as can neither Exerciſe Faith nor Repentance in it. Tell me, whether is greater, waſhing away Original Sin, or Regenerating and giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Kingdom of Heaven. O what a Reformation is this? If this be not amended, ſurely God's Hand will be ſtretched out againſt you ſtill. But you preſent Pariſh-Teachers, that practice this thing, Anſwer this ſober and neceſſary Queſtion: Do you believe this your own Doctrine and Practice to be good, or you rather do it becauſe this is the way to pleaſe the Times, and ſo to get Money? If the former, then are you blind Guides indeed. If the latter, then are you Covetous indeed. <hi>And Covetouſneſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is Idolatry.</hi> And then let all judge, whether either of theſe be fit to guide and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>And next, in their Marrying of People, beſides their manifold ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God's Name in vain, as in their other doings; and beſides, their evil Cuſtom of the Ring, do not they teach the People to ſwear and commit Idolatry, in ſaying, <hi>With this Ring I thee Wed, with my Body I thee Worſhip, and with all my worldly Goods I thee Endow;</hi> and at the concluſion of their Work, muſt plight their Troth one to another. Is this ſound Doctrine? Theſe Prieſts uſe to ſay the Scripture is their Rule. But no Scripture is there for certain for ſuch doings as this; but againſt it (if this be an Oath) for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but theſe Prieſts not only break this Commandment themſelves, but teach others ſo to do alſo; and ſo as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>are leaſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven:</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God only,</hi> but theſe teach People to Worſhip one another. And doth the Prieſt examine whether this be true, which he teacheth the Man to ſay to the Woman, <hi>With all my Worldly Goods I thee Endow?</hi> Or they matter not what they do? ſo as they can ſtubber over the buſineſs and get Money. But that which makes all this the worſe, is, that it muſt be declared to be done <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though never ſo unſcriptural and corrupt. And therefore will the Lord viſit for this thing alſo.</p>
                  <p>But from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> I do not find that there is any Command from God, either for Prieſts under the Law, or Miniſters under the Goſpel, to Marry People, nor ſo much as an Example that they did it. But the true Goſpel Miniſter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97179:52"/>keeps himſelf pure to Chriſt out of the World's Evil Cuſtoms and Self-Ends, leſt he come under Condemnation for partaking with them in their Sins: For now is the Cry gone forth from the Lord, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon <hi>my People, leſt partaking with her in her Sins, ye partake alſo of her Plagues.</hi> And therefore when People that pretend much, run into things without the Heavenly Call, it's no wonder to ſee ſo much Evil attend their doings.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> when they come to Bury People, having begun ſo badly, they continue ſo to the end; for having uſhered in the dead Body in their Superſtitious Surplice to the Grave, they muſt ſay, <hi>Earth to Earth, Aſhes to Aſhes, and Duſt to Duſt, in ſure and certain hope of Reſurrection to Life Eternal,</hi> of all they ſo Bury. Is not this a ſore E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to conclude ſo directly againſt Chriſt's words, who ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5.29. That ſome, not all, ſhall come forth to the <hi>Reſurrection of Life,</hi> and ſome to the <hi>Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> But you ſay all, at leaſt all, that come under your hands thus to be Buried, though they live and dye never ſo badly. Nay, theſe Buriers profeſs that they have a ſure and certain hope of it too, though oftentimes it ſo falls out, that they have no knowledge of the Party ſo Buried, neither of the Perſon Life nor Death. But what ſhall be ſaid to ſuch Prieſts and People whoſe Eyes are ſo blinded with Evil Cuſtom and Covetouſneſs, that they heed not much what they ſay or do, but heap up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, againſt their poor Souls. But the true Spiritual Man, the true Chriſtian, who is a new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus, ſees all theſe things, and judges them and avoids them.</p>
                  <p>And now, as for the Sermons, Prayings, and Preachings of ſuch corrupt Men as theſe, what are they good for, or what benefit hath or can your Souls, O People, expect to reap from them? <hi>Can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit,</hi> can Chaff Feed Peoples Souls? And he that hath not the Word it ſelf, which is Spirit and Life, and as a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Fire, though he may have and run with the Words that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare of it, as the Falſe Prophets of old did, for filthy Lucre, yet he is but a Dreamer and a Deceiver of his own and others Souls, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. And though for Witneſſing againſt ſuch as theſe do, I ſuffer Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet herein is my Joy, that the Lord hath deliver'd my Soul from the trouble which they lye in; and that I am accounted worthy to ſpeak for God againſt Deceit. So all People conſider what you have to do, for this is the day of the Revelation of all things reprovable; and ſo whatever hath been hid in Darkneſs, is now by the true Light to be made manifeſt. And though the Wicked in their ſeveral dark Forms, dig as deep as Hell, and think to hide their Counſels and their Doings never ſo deep in the Dark, yet to this Day of God which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97179:52"/>is already Dawned, and in great Power ariſen, muſt they all come forth to be judged, and to receive every one a Reward according to their Doigns, without reſpect of Perſons or Profeſſions, as teſtifies his good Spirit in and by his Servant,</p>

                  <p>MANY are the Enemies of the Glory of Chriſt in this his day, who through their wilful and affected Ignorance, would ſet up a Faith in the People, that purifies not their Hearts to God, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them Spotleſs and without Sin in his ſight, carrying the poor People in hand, that they may be Chriſtians and abide in Chriſt, though they Sin and do Evil, directly contrary to the plain Doctrine of the Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 6, 7, 8, 9. which <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>And ye</hi> (to wit the Brethren) <hi>know that he</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>was manifeſted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin: Whoſoever abideth in him ſinneth not: Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, nor known him.</hi> And amongſt theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt's Kingdom and Glory, are found even many who highly profeſs him in words, who therefore would be accounted better than others; yet upon true Search and Tryal, are as Ignorant of the Myſtery of God and Chriſt as any; as was yeſter day manifeſt by two of their Teachers; one whereof affirmed, That even the Perfection wrought by or in Chriſt, was not Sinleſs: And the other denying, and going about with all his might to prove, That this plain Scripture here ſet down, muſt not be underſtood literally as it ſpeaks; nor that other Verſe 9. of this forementioned Chapter, which ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> But it muſt, ſaith he, be underſtood ſome other way than the letter ſpeaks, otherwiſe (ſaith he) it would make People go out of their Wits, What none born of God that Sins?

I will bring a Scripture, ſaith he, to prove, That theſe words of <hi>John</hi> have ſome other meaning, and not to be underſtood literally as they ſpeak. Yet

                     <hi>H. Oſland,</hi> in one of his Papers, ſays, They follow the Lamb in all his ways. Which Profeſſion of his, though it be moſt Falſe, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, yet from his words I demand, Whether ſuch as follows the Lamb in all his ways, or whitherſoever he goes, do Sin, Yea or Nay? Is not the Lamb's way undefiled? And they that walk in that way are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, are they not? Are not theſe the Called, and Faithful, and Choſen? And then he turned to the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> Chap. 9.3. which ſaith, <hi>Yea, alſo the heart of the Sons of Men is full of Evil, and Madneſs is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the Dead.</hi> To which was anſwered, This ſhews only the State of Man by Nature in the Fall, and ſo under the Law and Curſe, and doth not at all concern the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, which Miniſters Righteouſneſs and Life to the Soul, and gives a new, clean and wiſe Heart, according to the Bleſſed Promiſe that ſaith, <hi>I will give them a new Heart, and Circumciſe their Hearts, that they may ſear me,</hi> ſaith God. According to that bleſſed Doctrine of the Apoſtles, which ſaith, <hi>To ſuch as really believed in-Chriſt, and ſo were not under the Law, but under Grace, ye are God's Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath ordained you ſhall walk in them.</hi> What will this Contender go on in his Blindneſs, Blaſpheming and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That Madneſs is in the Hearts of theſe while they live, and that theſe new Creatures, in Chriſt Jeſus, are full of Evil in their Hearts while they live, and ſo go to the Dead. O Sad, that ever ſuch ſhould take upon them to be Teachers of others, and be ſo Ignorant of the Goſpel-Myſtery themſelves: And therefore Woful and Miſerable muſt needs the Condition of all ſuch be that follow them; for as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, they muſt both fall into the Ditch;</hi> and in the Ditch they are both, in this day of God, manifeſted to be; and that which makes their Sin out of meaſure ſinful, is their Unwillingneſs to come out of it, though one do reach never ſo loving a hand of help unto them: Alſo by this we know, that they are no Meſſengers of God, who cannot put a difference betwixt the Precious and the Vile, to wit, between ſuch as are under the Curſe of the Law, and ſuch as are under Grace; to wit, betwixt ſuch as are born after the Fleſh, and ſuch as are born after the Spirit. But here the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> a true Miniſter of Jeſus, put the real difference, when he ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Epiſtle and Chapter, Ver. 7, 8 &amp; 10. <hi>Little Children, let no Man deceive you.

But on the other hand, Bleſſed and Happy for ever are all you who have believed in the Light Chriſt Jeſus, and abide in him with Thankſgiving, your Cup daily overflows with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bleſſings, from his Heavenly Fullneſs, and ye are Compleat in him who is the Head of all Principality and Power, and in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge; and in him abiding, you daily witneſs his Circumciſion in you, which is made without Hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, and not keeping on you the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, as the Hypocrites do, who only talk of Chriſt, but in his Life do not walk.</p>
                  <p>So all Dear People, who love your own Souls, and would know the Salvation that is in and by Chriſt Jeſus, come out from amongſt them that plead for the Devil's hold, which is Sin, Folly and Madneſs, to be in Peoples Hearts while they live, as though the Son of God were not come to deſtroy the Devil's Work, which is Sin, and ſo to cleanſe the Heart, Soul and Conſcience to God from Sin. And being come out from amongſt theſe Blind Guides, you will come Savingly in the Light of Jeſus, that leads forth from them (all you that follow the Light) to know daily more and more the things that belong to your Eternal Peace.</p>

None that doth good, nor knows the way of Peace, nor have any fear of God before their Eyes, but Deſtruction and Miſery are in all their ways,</hi> &amp;c. Now when they had brought this, I could not but ſomewhat wonder to ſee ſuch groſs Ignorance of the Goſpel in ſuch a Profeſſing People, for who could ſo have abuſed and wreſted Scripture, as to bring the wretched State of ſuch as are manifeſtly declared by their Works, to be under the Law and Curſe, to prove againſt the Happy State of ſuch as by Chriſt are delivered from both, and ſtated into the Holy Life
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97179:55"/>of God's own Righteouſneſs. And ſo theſe Profeſſors, who know not God nor Chriſt, are laying all theſe heavy Charges upon God's Elect, whom he juſtifieth. What have Chriſt's Members no fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes? And do not they know the way of Peace, but Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Miſery in all their Ways, like the wicked World, whoſe Mouths muſt be ſtopped; yea, yea, praiſed be the Lord for Ever; the Day-ſpring from on high hath vilited us that ſate in Darkneſs, and the true Light now ſhineth, that hath led the <hi>Zion</hi> of God out of all thoſe Condemnable Things before-mentioned, into the Way of Life, Truth, Holineſs, and Peace, Glory to his Name for Ever.</p>
                  <p>And ſo by this it appears how like theſe Prieſts and their Followers are, all ſucking at the Breaſts of that Myſtical Whore and Dragon that oppoſes the Lamb, and his Followers, but the Lamb ſhall always have the Victory, as he hath this Day, Glory to his Name over all. For a <hi>Voice came out of the Throne</hi> (ſaith <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 19.5.) <hi>ſaying, Praiſe our God all ye his Servants, and all yet hat fear him ſmall and great: And I heard as it were the Voice of a great Multitude, and as the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>FRIEND, I have received thy Lines, in anſwer to thoſe I ſent thee; and thou doſt rightly conceive of the ground of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to thee; for it was indeed out of pure Love to that which lieth in the Death in thee, thy Soul, unto which I ſpoke (though in the Death) to hearken to the Light of God that ſhines in thy dark Heart; for the Goſpel is Preached to the Impriſoned Souls, who are dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, that the dead may hear the voice of the Son of God, (even of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Goſpel it ſelf, the true Light and Life of Men, who ſhines in Darkneſs, though the Darkneſs do not comprehend it) and ſo live. And if thou haſt an Ear within open, thou may'ſt hear what here is ſpoken, and ſo there will be no contradiction in directing thee to a pure Principle, to attend to the pure Light of God within, freely given to guide to himſelf; but thou wilt, if thou be'ſt once indeed turned to the Teachings of that Light of God in thee, which ſhows thee thy Sin and Death daily, and calls to Repentance and Faith, ſee clearly that the Contradiction lies in the diſobedient Nature within in thy ſelf, as in all others without Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of what form or way of Religion (ſo called) whatſoever, that are diſobedient to the Light: But, dear Heart, ſo long as thou judgeſt of Spiritual things in thy Natural Reaſon, as here thou doſt, how many ſeeming Contradictions will there be in the Writings of the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, which never can be reconciled to that fall'n Wiſdom, but are all in Unity only to thoſe that are new Born in God, from before whoſe Eyes the Veil is done away in Chriſt, who is the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God to all that receive him in Love, but a ſtumbling Block, and Rock of Offence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fooliſhneſs to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who ſtumble and are offended at the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Stone (the Light within) through Diſobedience, as ſaith the Scripture: And therefore here will be thy Wiſdom, even to ceaſe from Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, and all the Wiſdom of his Words and Teachings which are without, and which ſtand in the Will of Man; and as was ſaid before, to hearken to the alone Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97179:57"/>of the Spirit of God, the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee within, which ſtand in a daily croſs to thy own Will and Reaſon and of all Men, and caſt off every weight and burden of Sin that hinders thy Soul from running the ways of God's Commandments, as in that Light they are diſcovered to thee; and ſo the Beam being removed out of thy Eye, and Judgment brought forth into Victory in thee, thou wilt ſee clearly into the Myſtery of Truth, as it is in Jeſus, which yet truly, the Veil of dark Fleſh being unremoved in thee, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that thou canſt not; and therefore in the Fear of God, ſink down into the deepeſt Humility, and willingly become a Fool, that thou may'ſt be wiſe; for to Repentance thou muſt come, which yet thou haſt not come unto, before thou enter the Kingdom; to that in thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do I ſpeak, which will ſhow thee this to be true, hearkening to it, though the Enemy at preſent in thee, it ſeems, whiſpers other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Oh! the <hi>Serpent is more ſubtil than any Beaſt of the Field,</hi> and hath deceived the whole Generation of the firſt Man, and doth, and therefore his Head being not yet bruiſed in thee, cauſeth thee to cover, but not with the Spirit of the Lord; and ſo the Woe will meet thee, till his Head be bruiſed in thee by the Seed of the Woman, which way ſoever thou turn thy ſelf. Therefore muſt thou paſs a ſtrait Gate, as all the Children of God have and do, before thou come to Feed on the Tree of Life; even the fiery flaming Sword muſt thou paſs, which is in the Hand of a Cherubin, which yet thou haſt not paſſed, and therefore thy own Life and Strength yet remain, which yet muſt go, or thy Soul Periſhes for ever; for that Sword muſt cut down the Subtilty, that that which hath led out from God may not lead to God; for it cannot, but the Simplicity (through the deſtruction of the ſubtile Serpentine Wiſdom) muſt enter, which breathes after God to do his Will, that muſt enter by Jeſus Chriſt. And for that thou preſſes the neceſſity of a ſearch, by what Spirit I was acted in Writing, and that becauſe, as thou ſay'ſt, theſe are Times of ſtrong Deluſion, wherein Multitudes are Captivated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou may'ſt know, that though it be true, that many are Captivated by Satan now, as at other times, and ſtrongly deluded, yet neither in theſe Times, nor any other, were any Captivated in thoſe Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but ſuch only as received not the Truth in the Love of it, but have Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs, even ſuch as turn the Truth of God into a Lye, and holding it in Unrighteouſneſs, becoming vain in their Imaginations, worſhipping and ſerving the Creature more than the Creator. And ſuch God in Juſtice doth indeed give up to believe a Lye, and to be ſtrongly deluded by thinking themſelves to be of God, and Chriſtians, when old things are not paſſed away from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97179:57"/>them, much leſs all things become new; and ſuch are they alſo that the God of the World hath blinded the Minds of ſuch who are mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Earthly Things, who live in the Luſt of Uncleanneſs, turning the Grace of God into Wantonneſs, having indeed a <hi>form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power,</hi> the daily Croſs, loving the Friendſhip of this periſhing Evil World, and the things thereof, as the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, making it hereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, they know not the true God in his Power and his Purity within them, but Worſhip they know not what, a God at a diſtance, far away from them, and a Chriſt by hear-ſay. And now, Friend, conſider ſeriouſly, and lay theſe things to Heart; for to thy Conſcience, in the ſight of God, I ſpeak, Doſt not thou love the things of this World? Art thou in Soul indeed ſeperate from them? Doſt thou not love Fineneſs in Apparel, Fineneſs in Dwelling, Fineneſs in Meat and Drink, Fineneſs in Speech, and Conformity to the World in their vain Faſhions and Cuſtoms in many other things? I ſay unto thee in tender Love, God is no reſpecter of Perſons, and doſt thou reſpect Perſons! Art not thou more afraid to Offend ſome than others, and more careful to pleaſe ſome than others, and that becauſe of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Friend, let me ſpeak plainly to thee, hath not thy fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing thy Carnal Relations, now at <hi>Hipſwell,</hi> been a cauſe of thy ſtrangeneſs to us; I know it is not altogether (as thou writeſt that) becauſe thou thinks us deluded, that thou art ſo eſtranged from our Fellowſhip, which once thou ſeemed to Love, but ſome other thing; the Light in thy Conſcience will let thee ſee what it is: Ah! the Croſs, the Croſs thou muſt bear, if thou ſhould'ſt now own us, will be, I fear, found in the Matter, though I know it will be heard to confeſs it, if thou hearken to the Serpent, and not to the pure voice the Light of God in thy Conſcience. Dear Heart, conſider it is not every one that ſaith <hi>Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, and thou wilt, I know, acknowledge, but thoſe only <hi>that do the Will of the Heavenly Father,</hi> which is Perfect and Holy; and though thou look at it now as ſomething harſh to be told of Diſſembling with the Lord within, yet I know through the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in me, if ever thou come to ſee in Truth the deep Deceitfulneſs of the Heart of Man, thou wilt ſee a diſſembling Nature lie lurking within thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many Vails, which now thou ſeeſt not, and though thou ſay now, <hi>Lord let thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> yet then when God comes to ſet up his Kingdom in thee, and ſo to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Son Jeſus Chriſt in thee, in the deſtruction of the Kingdom of the Devil, and of all thy own Wiſdom, Glory, and Idols, and ſo to do his Will in thy Earthly Heart, in ſhaking its Foundations, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97179:58"/>it up with the Increaſe thereof, thou wilt find ſomething in thee ſtrongly Gainſaying; yea, even Fighting and Oppoſing to Death, which yet thou art not acquainted with, and ſecretly wiſhing, that the way were not ſo narrow, but that thy <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might live before him, how much more in the ſwelling of <hi>Jordan</hi> will it be hard, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> is called for alſo; but thou muſt witneſs a forſaking of the World, and the Religion thereof, before thou ſee thy <hi>Iſaac</hi> Born, as did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the forſaking of his own old Country, and the rejection of his fleſhly Begetting, his Bond-Child <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> before the promiſed Seed appeared; now if thy Ear be opened, thou wilt this alſo hear. And for ſo many being beſotted with the lofty Notions and Expreſſions of ſome refined <hi>Monks</hi> thou ſpeaks of, thou had dealt Ingeniouſly if thou hadſt told wherein either I, or others with whom I have Fellowſhip in the Goſpel of the dear Son of God, are found Guilty; for if the Scripture Expreſſions be ſuch, we cannot deny them, though a <hi>Monk</hi> ſhould ſay the ſame; but I know thou canſt not, from any ſound Ground in thy ſelf, believe that we have Intimacy with ſuch as are called <hi>Monks,</hi> but thou art couſened into this Conceit by the falſe Reports of the envious and blind World, who do what they can to hinder the pure Truths progreſs, as they ever did by all means poſſible, together with what thy own miſapprehenſion of us hath ſuggeſted to thee. But herein is our Joy, that Men ſpeak all manner of Evil of us falſly, for the Names ſake of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom alone, through Grace we own for our Saviour and Guide, and not another; and therefore it is that the World hates us becauſe we cannot follow them in their Obedience to the Spirit of this World, as they do. And therefore, as I ſaid before, ſo in love I adviſe thee again, not to truſt in that vain Religion, that thou art yet unſeperated from, which ſtands in outward Obſervations, which hath not ſo much as a promiſe of Perfection in it, where there is yet, <hi>lo here, and lo there is Chriſt,</hi> where there is a <hi>Temple made with Hands,</hi> and a mention of Sins untaken away continually, as in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which was a ſhadow for a time, and could make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, ſeeing perfection was to be brought to Light in Jeſus Chriſt, the ſubſtance of all Shadows, Types, and Figures: And they that were Preachers of the Goſpel preached Perfection in him; And where Chriſt the Subſtance, the Lamb of God was manifeſted in any, it was for the taking away of Sin and perfecting in Holineſs, and ſo they could direct others. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97179:58"/>for the edifying the Body of Chriſt, till we all come to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And this being ſo, it is ſomething ſtrange thou ſhouldſt ſo far forget, as to ſay, thou knew not of any Text, in the whole Book of God, which doth promiſe to the People of God Perfection in this Life. For though as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The Law</hi> (which ſtood in outward Obſervations) <hi>made nothing perfect, yet the bringing in of a better hope</hi> (which hope is Chriſt, in the Saints a hope of Glory) <hi>did, by which they draw nigh unto God; Having their Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and their Bodies waſhed with pure Water,</hi> Heb. 10.22. And therefore there was a neceſſity of diſanulling of the Letter Commandment going before, becauſe of the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs of it, as in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> of that 7. <hi>cap.</hi> And ſo Friend, the reaſon of thine, and all the World's Imperfection, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and diſobedience to the Spirits teaching within, whereby the Soul is kept in the outward Court and Temple, and ſo not coming through the Vail, the Fleſh, which only is rent in the Death of Chriſt, the Holieſt of all is not come into, where there is Perfection, which Perfection indeed is not known in the Life and Glory, which is of the firſt Man, which ſtands in the Law of a carnal Commandment, but in the Power of an endleſs Life, without begining or end of Days; which alſo if thou haſt an Ear thou may'ſt hear, and the Lord give thee underſtanding that thy Soul may live, and not remain in Death, for the <hi>Letter Killeth, but the Spirit gives Life.</hi> And for my own Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which thou calls Imaginary Tranſcendent, thou knows I ſaid nothing of my ſelf in particular; and therefore be adviſed to beware of that Spirit that pats off wholſome Advice by evil Judgings and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſings concerning the Adviſers: For, for my own part, I acknowledge my ſelf to have nothing of my own to boaſt of, but to be by the Grace of God what I truly am, and that Grace is my Sufficiency, and rejoyce in this to ſee the ſtrength of Chriſt perfected in my Weakneſs, but Wickedneſs he Deſtroys, and will not allow of any work of Iniquity in any, and ſo in my Condition am I preſſing forward to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead, through the daily Death; and though I have not fully attained, yet I ſee every Gift of God to be perfect, and thoſe that reſt in Chriſt, reſt from Sin, and there are perfect; and ſo whom the Son ſets free are free indeed from Sin, and that where Chriſt is received, there is Power received to become a Child of God, and there the work of the Devil is deſtroyed, which is Sin; ſeeing he that commits Sin is not born of God, but is a Servant of Sin, and ſo a Child of the Devil. And therefore it is time for all to haſt out of the Spiritual <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> of Sin and ſeparation from God, leſt the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97179:59"/>Wrath that hangs over fall on, and there being no Remedy nor Eſcape. And for that thou entreats me to beware of the confuſed Notions and great words of <hi>Jacob Bewman,</hi> and ſuch like frothy Scriblers (as thou in diſdain art pleas'd to term them) who thou ſay'ſt may hereafter prove broken Reeds to thoſe who now admire them; thou may'ſt know, that thoſe who follow the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith he hath enlightned them in Spirit, which leads them orderly up out of the fall'n Eſtate of Sin and Separation from God into the Kingdom of perfect Righteouſneſs and Fellowſhip with himſelf, and lean not to any Man that can Deceive, but have all one Maſter and Teacher, which is Chriſt; in them all the Head, and they need not that any Man teach them, but as the Anointing leads them they are ſafe, and this the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture witneſſeth. And by the Holy Anointing in them; as alſo ſaith the Scripture, they try all things, both Men and Writings, Words and Works, and do ſeparate the Precious from the Vile, and know therein what to chuſe, what to refuſe, as the Mouth tryeth Meat, and yet are not Wiſe, as Men count Wiſdom, but Fools to the World, and their Wiſdom is in their Head, hid from the World, which is Chriſt the Myſtery, their Eye, and ſo the truly wiſe Man's Eye is in his Head, and ſo their Guide and Teacher is not Men or Means (as they are called) without them, but their Teacher is within in the midſt of them, and not removed into a Corner; and if any ſpeak not according to that Word within, it is becauſe they have no Movings in them. And if thou be'ſt humble-minded indeed thou wilt in Self-denial, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a daily Croſs to thy own Will and Wiſdom, wait with theſe ſimple Children and Babes of God in ſilence of Spirit to hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Light of Chriſt it ſelf alone, and not another ſpeaks within thee; and this thou wilt find to be a ſtraiter way than ever yet thou walked in when thy Mind muſt be kept in the Croſs, and not have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to feed upon any viſible or audible created Word, Writing, or Thing, but only upon the pure, immortal, and increated eternal Word of God within; then will the Serpent Rage, and the earthly Mind Famiſh, when it can come by no earthly Food. And for thy light Expreſſions of <hi>Jacob Bewman,</hi> (the reſt thou names not, and ſo I can ſay nothing punctually of them) I know in moſt things he ſpeaks a Parable to thee yet, and ſo his Writings may well be lightly eſteemed of by thee; but there is that in his Writings which, if ever thy Eye be opened, will appear to be a ſweet unfolding of the Myſtery of God, and of Chriſt, in divers particulars, according to his Gift. And therefore beware of ſpeaking Evil of that which thou know'ſt not, leſt thou come under <hi>Judas</hi> Reproof. But, dear Heart, thy poor Soul not yet freed, as I ſaid before, from the guidance of Self-Wiſdom,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97179:59"/>thou traveleſt in a Satisfaction with that which therein only thou canſt comprehend, and not only ſo, but therein alſo takes upon thee to judge that which is beyond it, which is very dangerous; but if Chriſt and his Kingdom were ſo known, it were no Myſtery. And for that thou queſtions what I mean by my exhorting thee to come up to the Feaſt of Tabernacles; if thou know'ſt the Scriptures which thou read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou may'ſt ſee what it is to come up to the Feaſt of Tabernacles, it is not to come up to any Man's Tenets or painted Novelties (as thou too ſcornfully miſcalleſt the Truth, we in our meaſure deſire to walk in) but it is to keep a Feaſt with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in the Wilderneſs, as tho' come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Travel and Warfare towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, having not for the preſent a City to dwell in, and ſo to be ſeparate from thy firſt Mother's Womb, which is from below, and is in Bondage with her Children, that thy feeding may be upon the Heavenly it ſelf, which yet is a Myſtery to thee, and all who cannot witneſs an Implantation together into the likeneſs of the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; if thy Ear be open thou wilt hear. And for that Scripture in the 7th of <hi>Matth.</hi> thou concludes with, thou may'ſt know that it doth not forbid the Judgment of the Spirit of Truth in any; but it truly and plainly ſhows to the Phariſee and Hypocrite his own Condemnation, who judgeth that in another which he is guilty of in himſelf much more. And therefore every one is to wait to ſee the Beam caſt out of their own Eye, and ſo Judgment brought forth into Victory in the particular, and ſo the true Spirit of Judgment ſet up in the Heart in particular, true Judgment, according to every Spiritual Man's meaſure, goes rightly forth upon the general, ſo as Chriſt there ſaith, there is ſo, a clear ſeeing how to caſt out the Mote out of the Brother's Eye, the Beam removed out of ones own. And now, Friend, if I ſhould ſeem tedious to thee, conſider it is my Love and deſire of thy Souls Information, that if poſſible thou may'ſt be delivered from every Snare to ſerve the Lord in the truth of Spirit, being taught of and guided by that Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned thee, leſt otherwiſe it be thy Condemnation, as it is, and ever hath been to all the Children of Diſobedience. So reſts thy poor Soul's continuing Friend,</p>

God's Righteouſneſs, and he that is born of Chriſt, ſinneth not, for the Heavenly Holy Father of the unſpotted Generation of the Righteous is he; And the Gates of Hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt ſuch as abide in Chriſt: The Root is Holy and ſo is the Branches, but the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> or Fallen Man, is not ſo, nor his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the Root being Corrupt, the Branches muſt needs be ſo; and ſo they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, but they who love the Light, Chriſt Jeſus, and walk in him, pleaſe God, for <hi>this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; Hear him,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and know ye not that Chriſt is in you except ye be Reprobates.</hi> So the Voice of Chriſt the living Word, (is to be heard and waited in) which is nigh in the Heart, and the pure in Heart walk in the Light of his Holy City; and to ſuch there is no occaſion of Stumbling; but ſuch as walk in the Darkneſs of their own Imaginations, ſtumble and fall into the Pit of Sin and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: But to ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus the Sinleſs Man, to them there is no Condemnation; for by his Spirit are they led and preſerved out of Sin, which is the cauſe of Condemnation, and come to witneſs Juſtification through his Blood; for if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light then have we Fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin. How beautiful is the way of the Juſt, they do not Iniquity that walk in God's undefiled way, the Light, for by the Light are they led out of Sin and Evil, and ſo come through the true Door Chriſt Jeſus the Light into the Sheep-fold, which is the ſtrait and narrow way indeed, for whoſoever walketh in Chriſt, and holdeth forth his Life before Men, ſhall be hated of all Men for his Name and Lifes ſake; for it is a Croſs to all the World, who are in their own Wills, doing the Will of the Fleſh, which is Enmity to God. And ſo Wo to the Climbers over the Door, who are gotten into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Chriſt, without his Croſs, without the Lord's Law, which is Spiritual, without the knowledge of that Flaming Sword to cut down the Man of Sin, that in the Birth which is Holy, one may come to the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Garden: O ye People, harken a while, who have been feeding upon the Tree of Knowledge,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97179:60"/>and never came through God's Judgments, the Flaming Sword, to the Tree of Life, your Food is Death, your Works will burn, and your Fig-leaf Covers will fall off, and you be left naked and bare to the Shame of your Nakedneſs, as in the day that you were born; For what is any Covering worth, unleſs it be that of the Spirit of Chriſt? The Lord God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, will bring your Deeds to the Light of his Judgment, and before him will nothing ſtand but that which is pure; your defiled Preachings, Prayings, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Hearings, Readings, will all be rejected and caſt out as Dung, from the Preſence of the pure holy God that conſuming Fire.

If you will work, you muſt into God's Vineyard, and be exceeding Diligent and Laborious in plucking up the Weeds by the Roots in you, the Light of Chriſt in the Conſcience waiting in it, will give the Underſtanding. But Wo will be to them that call Light Darkneſs, and put Darkneſs for Light, and ſo ſuffer the Good in them to wither, and nouriſh the bad part, which is like the Grave that never hath enough, always Learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth. But both Teachers and Hearers all in Sin, and laden with divers Luſts all their Lives long: And Wo to the Fleſhly and Selfiſh Workers on this Holy Sabbath day of the Lord, wherein he hath given his People Reſt from all their weary Labours and Burdens. The outward day, the Firſt day of the Week, ſhall not cover you, nor be a Sabbath to you, but in the Breach of God's Holy and everlaſting Sabbath you being found, you muſt bear his Judgment: And you feed upon the airy. Words of Man's Wiſdom, raiſed up by the Crafty Spirit to pleaſe the Itching Ears of Fallen Man, and whoſe Faith ſtands in the Wiſdom of theſe Words, and not in the Power of God; a day of Scattering cometh upon you, it cometh, and a grievous Whirlwind from the Lord; and though a Famine of the Word of the Lord is upon you already, yet you will not know it, nor he humbled for it; but the pleaſant Breaſts of Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> which you ſo much delight in, will be dried up, that you will get no Suck nor Food for that unſatiable Mind in you, that is like the Grave that

Or where is the Crucifying of the World to you, and you to the World, witneſſed amongſt you? Or any ſuch thing as the pure Worſhip of God, which ſtands in Spirit and Truth, wherein he only delights? But this poor Soul doth moſtly ſatisfie you, (to wit) to get a Carnal Man who loves to be called of Men Maſter, to ſay over a few deviſed words, (or ſo) which he calls Praying, and Preaching to pleaſe your itching Ears, but neither he nor you doing the things which Chriſt Commands you; nor do you live the Life of what in words you profeſs, and ſo to your other Sins you add that great Sin of Hypocriſie, which is in words to profeſs the Knowledge of God, but in deeds to deny it: But better it were for you all to mind the Fear of the Lord, and to conſider what end the Lord made you for, and not to paſs away your precious time ſo, without the Fear of the Lord God in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97179:62"/>your Careleſs Minds, as you do; for this you ſhould know, that the Lord of Glory, who reſpects no Man's Perſon will not be mocked, neither can the reſpecters of Perſons who love the Praiſe of Men, and ſeek the Worlds Glory live with him; for ſuch are Unbelievers, as receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not that Honour that comes from God only. See <hi>John</hi> 5. toward the end: And now that you have time prize it, and lay aſide your vain Thoughts a little, and in the cool of your Minds conſider, and let that of God in your Conſciences ſpeak, if it be not the greateſt Folly in the World, to Gain the Luſts of the World with the Loſs of your Precious Souls. And are you not in great danger of being found in this ſtate, ſo long as the true Prophet Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſent a Light into the World, (that all through him ſhould come out of Sin) is no more regarded by you. So now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time prize it, and know this Day of your Viſitation, and what indeed belongs unto your Eternal Peace. Reſts,</p>

                  <p>Now therefore, O all People, hearken to the Counſel of the Lord in this your Day, and learn of the Lamb, the Light, who calls you to Repentance from all your grievous Ways: How long ſhall the Spirit of the Lord ſtrive with you? When will you ceaſe learning War, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Oppreſſion, and Spoil? O when will you beat your Swords into Plow-ſhares, and your Spears into Pruning-hooks? O when will you go and ſay one to another, one Neighbour to another, and one Nation to another, Come let us all be humbled before the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who made us all of one Blood to dwell together upon the Face of the Earth in Truth, Goodneſs, and Love, to ſerve one another, and ſo as Branches of one Tree, to receive Life, and Vertue, and Power from our God into our Souls, to ſtrengthen us unto his holy Work, who came not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them, whoſe Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore is not ſet up or maintained with Carnal Weapons, Violence and Spoil, but by the Eternal Spirit of our God, whoſe Fruit is in all Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Truth; and let not the wicked Devil, the Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, deceive us any more, by his Lies and Deluſions, but let us all with one Heart and Soul reſiſt his Temptations, when he perſwades us to ſeek to be great in the Earth, and be avenged on them we count our Enemies, let us not hearken to him, but let us overcome their Evil with Goodneſs, and not to ſeek the Deſtruction of their Perſons, or Spoil of their Eſtates, as the Heathen do, that know not God, but let us follow the Example of Jeſus Chriſt, God manifeſted in Fleſh, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, but pray'd for ſuch as deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed him. O come let us follow this meek Lamb in Righteouſneſs and Truth, and let us learn of him in our Hearts, who is meek and lowly, that we may find reſt for our Souls, who rebuked his Diſciples who would have had Fire to come down from Heaven to deſtroy the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who would not at that time receive Chriſt; for what knoweſt thou, O Man, but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> may in time come to a better Mind, and then thou wilt ſee it was thy Will, and not God's, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their Deſtruction in their Sins; for Chriſt would have all to be Saved, and to come to the Knowledge of his Truth, but many will not come to him that they might have Life, and ſo their Deſtruction is of themſelves, and their Condemnation juſt. And who are now therefore thoſe that withſtand the Doctrine of the Truth, which ſaith, Love your Enemies, and ſeek not the Deſtruction of their Perſons and Eſtates, but ſeek them by good Doctrine, and good Life, to bring them out of their Sins. And if they will not, but rather hate thee for thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; be content thou haſt quitted thy own Soul, and art clear of their Blood, and ſo thou becomes a Sufferer with Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhalt

And that ſame Spirit in them which creates that falſe Peace in them, is the ſame that ſtirs them up to kill, deſtroy, oppreſs, and ſpoil one another for ſelfiſh and worldly Ends; but the Lord is ariſen to Judge all theſe Evil things, and to redeem a Seed to ſerve him, as in the beginning of the Goſpel before Antichriſt the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer got up amongſt them, that profeſſed Chriſt in Words, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in Deeds, and ſo had a Name that they lived, but were dead from that true Life that was in Chriſt Jeſus, whom in words they Profeſſed: And though the paſſage we feel now to be as hard of coming from amongſt the falſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as it was for the firſt true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to come from amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet the Almighty Power of our God is able, over all, and through all, to carry us to the End, whom he hath called and ſaved with a mighty Salvation, ever praiſed be his Name, and who will yet ſave his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Seed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and gather them from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and from the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> to ſit down with Chriſt in his Kingdom. And this is no ill News to any, but who are glewed to Deceit, and married to Iniquity: But it is good News and glad Tidings indeed to all that love their Souls, and the Honour and Glory of Truth more than the things of this periſhing World: And I could deſire, that all who are apt to reaſon as the <hi>Jews</hi> did when they heard the Declaration of the Goſpel of Peace, and Kingdom of God, which ſtands in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Peace, ſaying, <hi>If we let this go on, then the</hi> Romans <hi>and others will come and take our Place and Nation:</hi> I ſay, that they would conſider, that the very courſe which they, to wit, the old <hi>Jews</hi> in the denial of the Truth took for ſaving of themſelves, brought utter deſtruction upon them and their Nation: But what ſhall vain Man in his fooliſh fall'n Wiſdom, and Earthly Reaſonings, think to be wiſer than God, and to have a greater Care and Love to the Creation than God himſelf who made it hath. What, ſhall Angels, at the Birth of Chriſt, ſing <hi>Glory to God on high,</hi> and <hi>Good-will to Men,</hi> and yet, when the way of God in Chriſt is publiſhed, for bringing this great Work of Salvation to paſs, vain Man muſt come in with his falſe Mind, and ſay, This is the way to confound all Order, and deſtroy

And who is ſeeking ſuch Holy Worſhippers in this day of his Power, wherein he is ariſen to purge the Earth with his fiery flaming Word, and to ſlay the wicked with the Sword of his Mouth.</p>

So though many may think they do well, in doing thus againſt us in theſe days, becauſe we cannot conform to your Cuſtoms, contrary to that of God in our Conſcience: Yet know aſſuredly, we are juſtified in the ſight of God for what we do, and he will aſſuredly plead our Innocent Cauſe, as he did the Sufferers for Truth in thoſe former Days; and it will not be well with the Land, ſo long as theſe Yokes of Oppreſſion are upon us, who deſire nothing more than the Peace, Welfare, and everlaſting Good of the King and all People; but alas, it will not be ſo long as the Law, which ſhould be laid upon the Wicked Drunkards, Swearers, Unclean Perſons, and Waſters of God's Creatures upon their Luſts, is thus laid upon the Righteous, who live Peaceably, Righteouſly and Godly, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil World. And ſo you Judges, be awakened to true Judgment

Yea, though <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> ſtood before God to intercede for you, yet his Heart cannot be for you, ſo long as your many Sins, and this grievous Sin before mentioned, do remain: Yea, though you ſhould meet together every day in the Week, and call it a Faſt, and ſeem in the outward to humble your Souls, yet till theſe Burdens of Sin be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from off your Souls, and the Yokes of Oppreſſion from off Chriſt's Lambs, it cannot be well with you. Your Teachers may tell you of Sin in the general to be the cauſe of theſe Plagues, but they tell you not nakedly and truly for what the Hand of the Lord is lifted up againſt you, neither indeed can they, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Hearts, and the Spirit of deep Sleep that is fallen upon them. So Friend, theſe things are on me, as from the Lord, to advertiſe thee and you all of, in love to thy Soul and you all, and to deſire you, in the Name of the Lord, to lay them to Heart, and ponder of them, and not to paſs over them ſlightly, as too many have done, becauſe they come from ſuch a one as I, who am as a Man rejected by you: Yet the Lord loves my Soul, and cares for me, praiſed be his Name; and in the Patience, and Joy, and Strength of the Peace of God's Bleſſed Spirit, am I kept and preſerved in theſe continued Bonds and Sufferings for his Names ſake; and the Love of Chriſt conſtrains me to ſeek all your Good and Welfare in the Lord, though the more I do this, I be the more hated and perſecuted of ſome for my Good Will; but this I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not here to thee, but deſires that thou maiſt more and more keep thy Heart and Hands clean from the great Offence (to wit, the Hatred of Goodneſs and good Men) which hath ſunk Nations and Kingdoms into the Pit.

                  <p>WE, who are of the World called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do teſtifie, as in the ſight of the Bleſſed Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that we are clear in our Hearts from all Plottings or Contrivings of Evil or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt the King or any of his Subjects; and that our Meeting apart from the Steeple-houſe Worſhip, is meerly in Obedience to God and at his Command, who ſaith, <hi>Come out from amongſt them who live in Sin,</hi> and plead for the continuance of the Body of it (Yea in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate themſelves) during tearm of Life: And ſo while we touched the unclean thing with you, we could not be accepted of God; and therefore the Lord called us out, that we might meet together as we do, and have done theſe many years, in his holy Name and Fear, to worſhip him in Spirit and Truth, not in a Pretence, but in the real
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97179:69"/>Truth of the thing: And we have found his Heavenly Preſence with us, and his Holy Promiſe fulfilled amongſt us, which ſaith, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in Chriſt's Name, he will be in the midſt of them; Praiſes to him for ever.</hi> And now as concerning thoſe People called <hi>Monarchy-Men,</hi> who are Fighters with Carnal Weapon, and it ſeems did riſe up to diſturb the Peace of the Nation by outward Force, we do utterly deny; and not only them, but all others who think the Kingdom of Chriſt can be ſet up with a Carnal Weapon, or that his Church can be preſerved and kept clean by worldly Force, for God hath given us graciouſly to ſee beyond all ſuch things, and hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in us that Bleſſed Heavenly Power and Spirit of Chriſt, by which his Church, which is his Body, is raiſed up and preſerved, and builded up for evermore; and the Sword of this Bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus, which is the Word of God we know, for the cutting down not of Perſons but Sins, Praiſed be God; and ſo to the outward Fightings and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings our Hearts are dead, and we dare not avenge our ſelves as the wicked World doth, but to God to we commit our Cauſe in Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, for he is the Avenger of all Wrongs, and Pleader of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cauſe of his People in all Generations, Glory to his Name over all. And therefore it cannot be but a moſt unjuſt thing, that we ſhould ſuffer by a Law that was made againſt Plotters and Seditious Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticlers: I ſay, we who through the Grace of Chriſt are made to witneſs againſt all ſuch things from our very Hearts, and therefore it concerns all, who are in Authority, to ſee what they do, and to diſtinguiſh right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Matters, leſt they cauſe the Innocent to ſuffer, as ſome to their own Hurt have done, and ſo bring God's Judgments upon them; for not the greateſt that ever were upon the Earth, could eſcape God's Judgments who wronged his People, witneſs <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Houſe, and all the great Kings of the Nations in all Ages, who touched God's People, who were as dear to him as the apple of his Eye: Do you not remember what they did to <hi>Daniel</hi> for the Worſhip of his God, and how the Lord delivered him, and the Pit devoured his Adverſaries, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and falſe Accuſers? <hi>Daniel</hi> could not worſhip but according to the Law of the God of Heaven, and ſo we cannot worſhip but according to the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus: Muſt we therefore ſuffer; well we are helped by the Love of God, to rejoyce and bear patiently the Will of the Lord, until he plead our Innocent Cauſe, and judge in Righteouſneſs betwixt us and our Adverſaries, for in his Judgment is our Boldneſs, Glory to God for ever; but the Haters of the Good cannot ſtand before him.

                  <p>O thou that art called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> how art thou fallen! How art thou become the Plant of a degenerate Vine! How are thy Grapes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as thoſe of <hi>Sodom!</hi> who ſhall bring healing to thee, who haſt rejected the Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> that the Father brought to thee.</p>
                  <p>O thou <hi>fooliſh Child!</hi> how haſt thou trifled out thy precious Time about <hi>Toys</hi> and <hi>Trifles,</hi> and haſt not regarded the <hi>Voice</hi> of thy <hi>Maker,</hi> who hath waited all day long to gather thee, and to do thee good, but thou wouldſt not!

Thou art never able to ſatiate thy Soul with husks: Thou muſt come into the Father's Houſe before thou haſt Bread enough.</p>
                  <p>But thou ſay'ſt in thy Heart, Thou art a Queen, yea, That thou art Rich, and indued with Goods, and haſt need of nothing: When as alas in the true Light, thou art ſeen to be Miſerable, Poor, Wretched, Blind and Naked.

                  <p>But thou grew weary of waiting upon thy God, and ſaw <hi>Images</hi> of things on Earth, and <hi>Images</hi> of things in Heaven, and bowed thy Heart to them, and didſt not keep thy Heart to the power that broke thro' the Darkneſs for thee.

Yea, the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, which hath ſhined to thee, and would have gathered thee up to God, thou haſt rejected, and haſt not liked to retain God, nor his Light in thy Knowledge. And ſo thou art become vain in thy Mind, and thy fooliſh Heart is become ſo dark, that thou worſhips thou knows not what, like thoſe that know not God, and art become a Prey to every Beaſt of the Field, and art bowed in thy Heart to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> more than to the living God the <hi>Creator.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
                     <p>And the Judge asked us, If we knew where we were? To whom it was Anſwered,</p>

                     <speaker>Anſ.</speaker>
                     <p>To whom it was Anſwered, That ſome of the Men called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, now in Authority, had been heard to Condemn <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> for ſuch a thing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Here the Judge ſpoke ſomething of <hi>Oliver.</hi>

                     <speaker>Anſ.</speaker>
                     <p>But where is it read in Scripture, that the Apoſtles ſuffered for keeping on their Hats. To which the Judge replied, They had no Hats: And ſo proceeded to other things.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>But here by the way all may take notice, that the Scripture ſpeaks of Hats in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.21. which was long before the Apoſtles time; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtles had ſomething to cover their Heads withal; whether called Hats or Caps is not material: And that it is not putting off the Hat, but putting away deceit from the Heart, that Honours God's Authority.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the Oath, the Judge asked, If we would take it?</p>
                  <p>We Anſwered, Chriſt taught us not to Swear, but ſaid, <hi>Let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, for whatſoever is more cometh of evil.</hi>

                  <p>To which was Anſwered by one of us; yea, the Devil both did, and now alſo doth Swear, in the Mouths of all wicked Men, and that falſly alſo.</p>
                  <p>Then here about the Oath of Allegiance was read.</p>
                  <p>And it being read, one of us Anſwered whoſe Name was <hi>T. T.</hi> It ſeems this Oath was made againſt them called Papiſts.

                  <p>But for ſuch paſſages as theſe the Judge was at length troubled, and though he had been moderate a good while, yet he wanted all Patience, and ſo thought to proceed againſt me by the Act of Premunire; yet for a little ſpace he was ſeemingly willing again to proceed with me as with the reſt upon the new Act; and ſo they cauſed it to be read, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, I was made to ſay ſomething to this purpoſe, to wit, <hi>It ſeems then that your Intentions are to get us from amongſt you, and if it ſhould be ſo, that the Righteous were taken from you, would not God's Judgments fall upon the Land?</hi> And then the Judge threw up all as it were, and ſpoke in anger to the Grand Jury to draw a Bill of Indictment againſt me; and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97179:106"/>ſo I was as it were ſeparate from my Brethren, and ſet a-part for the greateſt Sufferings, and that as is ſaid for nothing but declaring Truth, and keeping my Conſcience pure to God, and ſo I was put by for that time.</p>
                  <p>Again, I was called certain hours after up to the Bar again, and then was that wicked thing, called an Indictment, framed and brought in againſt me: O what unchriſtian and unſavoury things was it fraught with, as though I had wickedly and contemptuouſly denied to take that Oath called Allegiance, which was made againſt Papiſts and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Plotters: When as the Lord knows I denied only to Swear in Obedience to Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and ſo to keep my Conſcience pure to God in the thing I denied to Swear, and neither in favour of Popery, nor in oppoſition to the King, as I had declared before from the Truth of my Heart, and the Judge himſelf was once made to acknowledge it, as is ſaid before, yet becauſe I could not lay my Hand on a Book and kiſs it, and ſo commit Idolatry, and becauſe I could not ſay <hi>I Swear, I Swear,</hi> or ſo, they proceeded to bring in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt me, as if I had been the greateſt Offender in this caſe that might be; even to Confiſcation of all in the outward World called Mine, whether Lands, Leaſes, Goods, Chattels and Liberty, though in the fight of God, and that juſt and righteous reaſonable Principle of God in every Man I ſtand clear, which is my Joy.</p>
                  <p>Yet before they proceeded to give Sentence, they would make a ſhew of Legal Proceeding, but it was only to deceive themſelves withall, for all others ſaw them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo after they had read that wicked Inſtrument called an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, ſome words paſſed from me in the dread of the Lord; as firſt, I declared my Innocency there, as to the thing charged upon me, in the ſight of the Lord God and all Men; and ſo warned the Judge to take heed what he did againſt an Innocent Man, for with the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was meaſured to others, God would meaſure to all Men again. And ſo ſpeaking again ſomething concerning Swearing, the Judge ſaid.</p>

But you might or ſhould hear, that I declared againſt them, yea, and my Declaration was from the Truth of the Heart, the Searcher of Hearts knows it: And I alſo expreſſed my real Innocency and good Deſires concerning the King, and all Men: Inſomuch that the Judge himſelf confeſſed, I had as it were confeſſed to the thing in the Subſtance. And ſo you may ſee, if I Suffer, it is for Formalities, and not for Subſtance. For I believe, that that Cuſtom of Swearing upon, and Kiſſing, a Book, was firſt invented in the Dark Time of Popery, when Mens Minds were wholly, as it were, alienated from the Life and pure Knowledge of God, and gone into Idolatry. And ſo be not ye guilty of Sinning againſt God in this Matter? Neither let any of you have a hand in Oppreſſing a Man and his Houſe, a Man and his Family; For if you be wiſe you will ſee, that taking that which God hath lent me in this World, for the Service of my Outward Man and Family, will not be a Bleſſing in the King's Treaſures; For it's Righteouſneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the King's Throne, and nothing of the contrary.

Only ſometimes, when my witneſs is reached in you, a little is done by ſome of you for my Babes; but then your Goodneſs ſtays not, but paſſeth away like the early Dew, and then your evil Hearts turn back again from me, and then you take Counſel one at another how to eſtabliſh your own Kingdom, Wills.

And ſo the ſame Spirit that ſo committed me, could not be ſatisfied until it had ſeen me run to a Premunire, as they call it, for not Swearing; though the Man called Judge <hi>Tirrel,</hi> who did it, confeſſed before all the Country, I ſpoke or confeſſed the Subſtance of that Oath, called the <hi>Allegiance,</hi> yet premunired me for want of kiſſing the Book, or ſaying, <hi>I Swear, I Swear,</hi> or ſo, which are but light Matters compared with the Subſtance: For I told him and the reſt, that Popery I was againſt, but not againſt the King, or good Government of this Nation. And therefore as the Lord hath, ſo will he ever judge Righteouſly betwixt me and my Perſecutors, and bring the Wheel of his Judgments upon the Wicked, his Enemies.</p>

And what Chriſtian Heart can endure to ſee one Creature tear, and ſpill the Blood, and torment one another, and that for no cauſe, but only to ſatisfie the Luſts of ungodly and lewd, vain and cruel Minds of the Multitude?

                  <p>Therefore awake, awake, ariſe, ariſe, for the great Day of the Lord is indeed nigh at hand, yea the Sun is already ariſen, and his bright Glory ſhineth upon the Sons of the Morning, and the true fearching Light, from which nothing can be hid, is felt and known in the Earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it the Workers of Iniquity are as Chaff, and before it can no mortal Man ſtand in Judgment, though he gliſter never ſo much in outward Glory in the Worlds eye; for in the preſence of this Light, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceedeth not according to Perſon or Worldly Appearance, but according to Truth, Equity and Righteouſneſs; and ſo every Evil doer hates this Light becauſe his Deeds are Evil, and the Light reproves him to his Face, and in his Heart, without reſpect to his Perſon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none but they whoſe Deeds are wrought in God, can willingly come to this Light with their Deeds, or endure that this Light ſhould paſs Judgment on them; for it's the Righteous only that hath Praiſe in the Preſence of this pure God, the <hi>Light who lighteth every Man that cometh into the Word;</hi> and is come a <hi>Light</hi> in the World, <hi>that all through him might believe,</hi> and come out of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and the Deeds thereof, and be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>So if any of you periſh, it is in your love of Darkneſs, and your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of your ſelves,</hi> for God would have you to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and to that purpoſe holds forth his Love in his Light to your Conſciences daily, that you might be warned and not periſh: And if this Goſpel of his Love and Grace, the Light, be hid from you, it is becauſe the <hi>God of this World,</hi> with his deceitful Allurements, <hi>hath blinded your Eye.</hi> Mark, <hi>The God of this World hath blinded your Minds;</hi> that Old Sepent who is called the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air, which works in the Hearts of all Diſobedient ones,</hi> hath captivated your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if this Goſpel of Light you perceive not to Love and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97179:121"/>Obey it. And conſider how the Power of Darkneſs deceives Man; it begins with him betimes, and works ſubtilly with him in his Mind when he is tender and young, carrying him forth eagerly after Childiſh Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Youthful Luſts, if by the Light, that ſecretly Checks for theſe things, he be not reſiſted. The World tells the Youth, that by going forth into ſome Form of Religion, and conforming to that, is God's way, by which Man may be helped againſt his Sin; but God, the Truth, ſaith, <hi>I have laid help upon One that is mighty,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus the Light, who is to be known in Man, a preſent help againſt Sin. And, <hi>by what means,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, may a young Man cleanſe his way,</hi> ſave only <hi>by taking heed according to the Word of God.</hi> And, <hi>the Word is nigh, in the Heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, diſcerning the Thoughts and Intents thereof.</hi> And, <hi>the Light ſhineth in Darkneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> (in Man) yea, <hi>in every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> making <hi>all things</hi> in <hi>ſecret, manifeſt;</hi> and who can bide their Deeds from it? So if the young Men come not to this Light, then they abide in Darkneſs, and grow up in Darkneſs, and covering themſelves, but not with the Spirit of God, ſo long, until there be no Remedy, but the Wo and the Curſe muſt needs come upon them. But <hi>he that followeth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, (the Light) <hi>ſhall not abide in Darkneſs,</hi> Sin nor Evil, <hi>but ſhall have the Light of Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear,</hi> and mind the Light of Chriſt in you, that lets you ſee all that ever you have done, and ſets before you your Sins in order, and brings Judgment and Condemnation upon your Souls for them: And love the Light and its righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for <hi>Zion</hi> muſt be redeemed through Judgment; and bring all your Deeds, Words and Thoughts, to this Light of Chriſt, and hide not any thing from it; for he <hi>that hideth his Sins,</hi> from the Lord, <hi>ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.</hi> But he that in this true Light ſees his Sin, and forſakes the Sin, and turns to God in his Light, and abides therein, ſhall be Bleſſed. But Wo is the Portion of ſuch as turn not to him that Smites them, but inſtead of owning the Pricks and Reproofs of Wiſdom, kick againſt them. Theſe are the Ungodly, whoſe Sacrifice the Lord could never accept; but they abiding in their Sins, all their Prayers and Performances were ſtill returned upon them, from the pure God, as Dung upon their Faces. Therefore, <hi>go not forth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (which he compared to many little things) <hi>is within you: And when they ſhall ſay, Lo here, lo there,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>go not after them:</hi> For thoſe that draw People from the Light and Spirit of Chriſt (that Holy Anointing within) in Man, were always Antichriſts.

And of this ſort are they that not only in the days of Chriſt <hi>withſtood him,</hi> but even the ſame that in all Ages <hi>withſtood his Spirit and Work,</hi> as at this day. For with ſuch earthly-ſpirited Teachers it was, that the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Heart was ſo broken in his day, as one may read all along the 23d Chapter of his Propheſie, and of whom in his fifth Chapter he ſo grievouſly complains, ſaying, <hi>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple love to have it ſo. And therefore Deſtruction from the Lord came upon them all.</hi> And theſe Teachers ſaid ſtill in their lying earthly Spirit, <hi>that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>(though ſinful) ſhould have Peace, and that no Evil ſhould come upon them People, though they walked every Man after the Imagination of his own evil Heart,</hi> Jer. 23.17. And of this ſort were they that the Lord ſent his Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> to cry againſt, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophets that make my People to err; that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and he that putteth not into their Mouths, they even prepare War againſt him: Therefore Night and Darkneſs came upon them, and the Viſion ceaſed from them in the juſt Judgment of God. For a ſelf-end was in all their Work, and the dead Fly of Covetouſneſs corrupted all:</hi> As one may read at large in the third Chapter of his Propheſie, Verſe 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of this ſort are they, that <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Prophet of God, in his time ſo grievouſly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97179:122"/>complains of alſo, as one may read in the 96th Chapter of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, ſaying, Verſe 9, <hi>&amp;c. All ye Beaſts of the Field come to devour; yea, all ye Beaſts of the Foreſt: his Watch-men are blind, greedy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all looking for their own way, every one for his Gain from his quarter,</hi> &amp;c. And againſt this ſort of earthly-ſpirited Teachers it was that God ſent his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to cry Wo againſt, ſaying, <hi>Wo to the Shepherds of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that do feed themſelves; ſhould not the Shepherds feed the Flock? Ye eat the Fat, and ye cloath you with the Wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flocks.</hi> And ſo the God of this World, through Pride and Covetouſneſs, had ſo blinded their Eye, and corrupted their Hearts, that they had neither Will nor Skill to help nor heal the poor diſeaſed, ſick, broken, ſcattered Souls of their Hearers; and therefore the Lord was glad to put them aſide as <hi>Phyſicians of no value,</hi> and became the Teacher of his People himſelf; as one may read in the 34th Chapter of his Propheſie throughout. <hi>Glory to the Lord, who hath fulfilled his Promiſe to his</hi> Iſrael <hi>this day;</hi> and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Teacher of his People himſelf, whereby they come to be truly profited, as it is written, <hi>I the Lord thy God teach thee, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to profit.</hi> But the fore-mentioned Teachers, who have run in their Wills, for Self-ends, and the Lord never ſent them, could never profit People at all: And as Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and his true Prophets, in former times were trouble and oppoſed by ſuch Hirelings: So alſo the true Apoſtles of Chriſt did not eſcape the Trials and Oppoſitions of that deceitful Spirit by which they were acted, <hi>For ſuch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> are <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, Satan's Miniſters, transforming themſelves into the likeneſs of the Apoſtles of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. Some of theſe were already come in his day: <hi>And I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that after my departure grievous Wolves ſhall come in among you, not ſparing the Flock: Alſo, of your own ſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them,</hi> Acts 20.29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the Kingdom of Antichriſt grew, theſe perverſe things were eſtabliſhed for Doctrine by a Law: For the very Name of Antichriſt holds forth a Spirit oppoſing it ſelf to every appearance of Chriſt, and of his Holy Spirit and Anointing in Man.</p>
                  <p>The true Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt drew the Soul from Men and ſelf, unto Chriſt, and his Anointing in them, to know that to teach them: But theſe, and all other Falſe Teachers, draw from Chriſt and his Anointing within, to look at Fleſh and Form without, which perfects not at all to God. <hi>And of this ſort alſo are they,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Paul, which creep into Houſes</hi> (underſtand the great ſtone Houſes, called Churches, as well as others) <hi>and lead captive ſilly Women, laden with ſins, led away with divers Luſts; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. <hi>Of this ſort,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, as ſhall come in the laſt perilous

And though theſe Deceivers have proceeded for a time, to wit, during the late Night of Apoſtacy, which <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. ſpake of, <hi>to deceive many;</hi> yet now that the Light is riſen again from under the Earth, they are manifeſt, and can proceed no further. Let none therefore now be ſo void of underſtanding, as to brand the true Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt in this Day, with the Name of Deceivers, becauſe they declare Truth, not only publickly, but alſo from Houſe to Houſe, by virtue of the Holy Spirit only; for ſo did the Apoſtles themſelves, and yet were no Creepers into Houſes; for creeping into Houſes denotes the Work of the Children of Darkneſs, who run without the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Spirit, or Authority, in their own Wills, for Self-ends, as before; leading about People in their ſillineſs and ſinfulneſs all their Days, as by woful Experience, in the late Ages of the World, ſince the Apoſtles Days, hath been fully manifeſt; wherein the <hi>World hath wondred after the Beaſt.</hi> And <hi>as there were falſe Prophets among the People,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, even ſo alſo ſhall there be Falſe Teachers among you; who ſhall privily bring in Damnable Hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But how may theſe be known, may ſome ſay? <hi>By their Fruits,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall know them. And of this ſort are they,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame Chapter, <hi>who through Covetouſneſs, with fained words, make Merchandize of People; and by walking after the Fleſh, in the Luſt of Covetouſneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and Deſpite of Chriſt's Government, even deny the Lord that bought them.</hi> Theſe are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Ones indeed, who count it Pleaſure to Riot in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, ſpeaking evil of the worthy things that God works and makes manifeſt in his Children, which theſe Preſumptuous Ones know not. And theſe falſe Teachers are of thoſe whoſe Eyes are full of Adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from Sin: For how ſhould they, ſeeing their Heart is exerciſed with Covetous Practices, loving the Wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, like <hi>Balaam,</hi> as he (to wit, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>) there ſpeaks. And therefore, thoſe that ſee not theſe are Blind indeed; and thoſe that theſe Teachers can deceive, may well be ſaid to be without a Foundation: And hence it hath come to paſs, that through ſuch Teachers Wickedneſs, and Peoples Ignorance, the World hath been as a Wilderneſs. And now therefore is the Lord, according to his Bleſſed Promiſe, bringing up that knowledge of himſelf and his Chriſt again, that ſhall <hi>make the Wilderneſs a fruitful Field, and ſweet ſmelling
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97179:123"/>Garden for himſelf to be glorified in.</hi> And this <hi>knowledge of God ſhall cover the Earth as the Waters do the Sea.</hi> And thereby <hi>ſhall all hurting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying be done away from amongſt Men, Iſa.</hi> 65. laſt; as is this Day wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed amongſt ſuch where this Knowledge of God hath place. Glory to his Name for Ever. So now therefore, all ye Kings, Princes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates and Rulers of the Earth, ſee in what Principle you ſtand, and upon what Foundation you grow, and whoſe Work you are a doing; whether God's or your own. True Magiſtrates are not a Terrour to the good, but to the evil. But how can ye ſee the good and the evil truly aſunder, or know what to puniſh, and what to protect, if you come not to the Light, Chriſt Jeſus, that true Light <hi>which lighteth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that cometh into the World</hi> (as was ſaid before) to take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at him, for <hi>he is the Wonderful Counſellor:</hi> and whatſoever makes things truly manifeſt is his Light, and with it every hard thing is known, and every ſecret thing found out, but without it nothing; but all People that walk in the Darkneſs of their own Underſtandings, do err in Viſion, and ſtumble in Judgment, and ſo know not what they do, nor whither they go: And this way that ſeemeth good in the Mans own Eye, is that which always tended to Death, and diſordered all things. And by ſuch a Judgment <hi>Barrabas</hi> was Releaſed, and the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Jeſus delivered to be Crucified; and by this the falſe Prophets in all Ages were protected and born up, and the Dear Servants of Chriſt caſt out as a thing of nought.</p>
                  <p>So ariſe, ariſe; awake, awake to Righteouſneſs, and Sin not, for the Lord is on his way to give unto every Nation, and each People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Rewards according to their Works, without reſpect of Perſons. And until God's Righteouſneſs rule in all, and over all, how can any thing ſtand, let that of God in all Conſciences judge; ſo lay things to heart, for this is the Day of your Viſitation. Alſo, you Biſhops and high Teachers, who are pleaſed in your Minds becauſe accepted of Man; conſider, <hi>Are you accepted of God?</hi> Is your Sacrifice ſo pure, and your Perſons ſo innocent, that the Holy God can receive them?

And lay by your Carnal Weapons, and make proof of your Spiritual Weapons (if you have any) and try a little, how you can perſwade Men to be of your Mind by that means: For People begin to queſtion much the forcing of Men into Religion by the carnal Sword, and outward Conſtraint, whether it be of God or no. For it's found by Experience, that into what People are forced by the outward Power, by the ſame means may they be forced out of that again, and ſo remain reſtleſs, and without a Foundation, until the Truth it ſelf ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them. So ſet not up your reſt in the Wilderneſs, much leſs in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but look towards the Holy Land, the undefiled, unmoveable Foundation, and ſuffer others to do ſo too. And thoſe that have ſpied out the good Land, hinder them not from entring in, but help them on in their Journey, if you can, leſt you be found Fighters againſt God. For now is the Effect of every Viſion coming in; and a feeble one in this Bleſſed <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is deſcended, and daily coming down from God out of Heaven, <hi>is as</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>as the Angel of God before them,</hi> Zach. 12.8.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The true Prophet, Meſſenger or Teacher is ſent of God (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in the Power and Spirit of God, with the living Word of God, which is as a Hammer and a Fire, to break the hard Hearts in ſunder, and to burn up the Chaff and Droſs in the Minds of Diſobedient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who know God's Will, but do it not, but hold the Truth in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The falſe Prophet or Teacher, <hi>he runs in his own Will, and having ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the Word from his Neighbour, uſeth his Tongue to ſay, the Lord ſaith, when the Lord never ſent him, and ſo with good Words and fair Speeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Hearts of the unwary Hearers, making glad the Hearts of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and crying Peace, when the Lord hath not ſpoken it.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The true Prophet, Teacher or Miniſter, as he hath received free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo he miniſters freely; but the falſe Teacher, as he runs in his own Will, ſo he miniſters for a Self-end; and if <hi>People put into his Mouth, he cries Peace, but if otherwiſe, he prepares War againſt them, and out of his corrupt Heart cries, Give, and can never have enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The true Miniſter hath a Mouth always open for God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin and Evil in every Appearance of it, without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and like a true Watcher gives notice of the Wolf's approach, and doth not flee when the Wolf comes, but oppoſes him in the Loſs of all, becauſe Chriſt's Sheep are dear to him: But the Hireling fleeth, becauſe he is a Hireling, and careth not for the Sheep; and as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin, it may live in People for Ever for him, for he cannot bark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, he is ſo full of it himſelf; for how can he that is an Unclean,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97179:126"/>Covetous, Proud Perſon himſelf (with a Face) ſtand againſt ſuch Sins in others; nay, nay, the barking of ſuch muſt needs be againſt ſuch as do from the Heart depart from Iniquity, and ſo ſeparate from ſuch as live in it, according to the Call of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The true Prophet, Miniſter or Teacher fights the good Fight of Faith, and his Weapons are Spiritual, and not Carnal, and ſo he ſights not with Fleſh and Blood, to deſtroy Mens Perſons, Liberties or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but his War is with the wicked Devil (the Power of Darkneſs in Men) that ſeparates Mens Minds, Hearts and Souls from God, and brings them into Sin's Captivity, and ſo under God's Wrath; and ſo the true Miniſter's Work is to Preach People out of that woful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Liberty of the Sons of God: But the falſe Teacher or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter his Weapons are Carnal, and he runs to the worldly Powers to help him againſt ſuch as oppoſe his evil Doctrine and Practice, crying, <hi>Men of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. help,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> cried out againſt <hi>Paul, Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>help,</hi> and ſo matter not though they weary the Magiſtrate, and ſet all the World in an Uproar, to keep themſelves up in their high Places of Deceit, and ſo prove the greateſt Enemies againſt God's Truth and his Servants of all other, as is abundantly to be ſeen in Scripture, concerning the Prieſts and their Confederates, who Preſecuted Chriſt to Death, and raged againſt his Followers, becauſe of their holy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for God againſt their Soul-deſtroying Ways.</p>

The true Meſſengers and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, as they are powerfully ſent of God, ſo they work effectually for God, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Body of Chriſt, and perfecting of his People in Holineſs to God: But the falſe Teacher, as he hath run without God, ſo his Work is for ſtrengthning that Part in Man (to wit, the Serpent's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) which is againſt God, and wars againſt the Simplicity of Chriſt and Good of the Soul in all; and ſo they being themſelves out of that Heavenly Power which perfects the Soul to God, and gives it perfect Victory over all Sin, they cry, <hi>No Perfection here, no perfect Victory over Sin on this ſide the Grave; and ſo they lead about a People laden with Sin and Luſt, ſilly as Woman in the Tranſgreſſion, ever learning, and never able by their Means to come to the Knowledge of the Truth itſelf, which ſets the Soul free from all Sin;</hi> for how ſhould People ever come to the Knowledge of the Truth by following ſuch Teachers as are out of the Truth? <hi>For if the Blind lead the Blind, muſt they not both fall into the Ditch?</hi>

                  <p>THE Indignation of the Lord is upon all Nations, and his Fury upon all their Armies; he will greatly diſtreſs the Inhabitants of the World, he will now plead the Cauſe of his Covenant of Light againſt all thoſe that withſtand his Glorious Appearance, and Work of Reſtoration, in this the day of his Mighty Power, wherein he is giving the Kingdom of his Everlaſting Peace to <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Seed under the whole Heavens, who fear his Great Name, and tremble at his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Word of Life, which ſhakes not only Earth, but Heaven alſo: And now is the Lord God Almighty bringing forth his Glory to light, and creating the new Heavens and new Earth, wherein dwells Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, according to his Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the People beat their Swords into Plow-ſhears, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, never to learn War any more; but every one now that believes in the Truth, Chriſt Jeſus, the Light, and true King of Righteouſneſs and Peace, ſhall ſit under him, the true Vine, and none to make them afraid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, even now, is the Lord God Almighty ariſen, and got up into his high Throne of Majeſty and everlaſting Glory to Reign; and of this his Peaceable Kingdom, which he hath begun to ſet up in his Trembling People, there never ſhall be End. The true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97179:130"/>is now coming up out of the Spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> indeed, to poſſeſs the true Land of Promiſe, the Inheritance and Free Gift of our God; and no Inchantment ſhall now ſtand againſt God's Spiritual Hoſt, nor Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the Redeemed of the Lord, who have known his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Deep, and known the Out-goings of God's Power againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt, in the <hi>Red Sea</hi> of his Fiery Indignation. And now will God be exalted in Judgment, and avenged in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, upon all Nations and People under Heaven, who hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, and will not that God's Holy Son Chriſt Jeſus, the Light, ſhould reign, though he be come to Reign and Judge in the Earth. For to him, the Light, who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, is all Power in Heaven and Earth given. And his Light ſhines freely into all your Hearts, O all People of the Earth; and ſhineth in the thickeſt Darkneſs to make manifeſt the Creator's Will to all your Conſciences, though your Darkneſs, O People, comprehends it not; but it comprehends you, and all your dark Ways, and deſtroying Phoughts; and lets you ſee plainly, That for all your great Workings, and toilſom Labour in an Out-ſide Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in your Earthly Wills, you have wrought no Deliverance in the Earth; but your Souls Enemies ſtill ſtand in ſtrength. And it lets you ſee, that for all your Striving, and Fighting, and Killing, and Spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Deſtroying one another about Earthly Things, you have done no good at all; but brought God's Judgments upon all your Souls, and pierced your ſelves through with many Sorrows.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Heavenly Voice ſounds through the Earth, and calls aloud in your Ears, and knocks at the Door of your Hearts, O all People of the World, High and Low, Profeſſor and Prophane, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Chriſtians,</hi> ſo called, and <hi>Turks;</hi> Ariſe, Ariſe, Awake, Awake, turn in your Minds to the pure Light of Jeſus Chriſt the Judge of Quick and Dead, the Son of the eternal God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who died for your Sins, and roſe again to give you a New, Holy and Everlaſting Life in himſelf, through Faith in his Name. And behold, he lives for evermore. And all ſee and ſearch diligently in your ſelves, what you know of his Holy Life made manifeſt in you, to deſtroy the Body of Sin and Death in you, which in the days of Darkneſs hath filled your Veſſel, and brought your very Soul, Mind and Heart into the Thraldom of that Wicked One, who is called the Devil and Satan, and compaſſed with Terrors, and Fears, and Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, your very Life, and whole Man, becauſe of the Wrath of the Almighty, which you by your Sinful, and Unrighteous, and Unholy and Cruel Doings, both againſt God and your Neighbour, have ſtirred up againſt you. And behold, the Earth languiſheth becauſe of theſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97179:131"/>things; and the Children of Light, who are redeemed to God, out of theſe ſore Evils and grievous Plagues, do mourn for you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail your Miſery Night and Day, as well knowing in the Light of the Lord, what your woful End will be, if theſe Bryars and Thorns, and noiſom Weeds (the proper Fruits of the Curſe) be ſtill ſuffered to grow in you, and cumber God's Ground. Oh! how nigh unto Curſing is that Field, which God's Rain rains upon, and yet brings forth no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Fruit,</hi> than <hi>Killing,</hi> and <hi>Slaying,</hi> and <hi>Spoiling,</hi> and <hi>Couſening,</hi> and <hi>Cheating,</hi> and <hi>Defiling,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſing</hi> one another, beſides <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> of God's Righteous Seed, with all other Abominations of the World againſt the Holy Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Checks and Reproofs of the good Spirit of the Almighty, both in their own Conſciences, and the Mouth of God's Servants, and Holy Witneſs of Truth in the Scriptures, which notwithſtanding all theſe their Abominations, many of them profeſs to be their <hi>Rule.</hi> But know, O Man, whoever thou art, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Profeſſion</hi> thou art of, that that's thy God and Ruler, and Father, and Teacher, and Way, whoſe Commands thou loveſt, and whoſe Works thou doſt, and whoſe Will in the inward of thy Mind thou clofeſt with: As Chriſt ſaid to thoſe Lyars, falſe Accuſers and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers in his Day, <hi>John</hi> 8.44, &amp;c. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, for his Works ye will do; he was a Lyar and Murderer from the beginning.</hi> So thou that goeſt from the Light of God in thee, which ſhews thee thy Sin, and the evil Luſtings and Deſires of thy Fleſh and Mind, thou goeſt from God, and from his Fear, and from the Way of Peace: And ſo, thou going from this, and joyning to evil Motions of Sin in thy Fleſh and corrupted Mind, thou joyneſt to the Devil, and ſo bringeſt forth Sin, which is the Devil's Work; and the Wages of every ſuch Work is Death. And ſo in the very moment of time, in which thou doſt the evil Work, whatſoever it be (contrary to God's Light in thee) thou dyeſt the Death; and ſo remaineſt dead from the Life of God, and his bleſſed Righteouſneſs, until the Day of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment of Life: And then what will it profit thee to have gained the World, or Victory over thy Neighbour, or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to thy Luſts, to the Loſs of thy Soul's Life?</p>
                  <p>Therefore Ariſe, Ariſe, Awake, Awake; O all Nations and People! Come forth to the Judgment of this great Day of God Almighty: For now is the effect of every Viſion to be known and felt in the Earth, and the High Towers of the City of Confuſion, the Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, the Mother of Harlots, ſhall fall to the Ground; and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Houſe of the Lord ſhall be exalted over all; yea, the Lord alone, and his Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and Peaceable Kingdom on
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97179:131"/>the Top of all ſhall ſtand; and no Weapon formed againſt him and his People ſhall ever proſper any more.</p>
                  <p>And how is it, O all Nations, Kings and People, that ye are not yet willing, after ſo long a time knocking at the Gates of your Cities and Doors of your Hearts, that ye will not open to the King of Glory, Chriſt Jeſus, the Light, <hi>that lighteth every one that cometh into the World,</hi> that he may come in, and be Judge, Lawgiver, and King in the midſt of you, that the Deſire of all Nations may come, and be Head in all? For what is it that the Soul that God hath made in all Nations doth deſire, but to ſee it ſelf unburthened of that grievous Corruption, which hath defiled it, and to be delivered from that Body of Sin and Death, which hath and doth ſo imbondage it from the beginning, until the Day of Chriſt's Power be known within, to work the Work of God, and to deſtroy the Work of the Devil, and to ſave the Soul from its Sin, and to preſent it ſpotleſs to God, which is the true Salvation indeed?</p>
                  <p>Now this is my Witneſs for God amongſt the Servants and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord this Day, whom the World in Scorn calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> (who am a Sufferer with them for the Kingdom of God's ſake) That there is none can thus know the Day of Chriſt's Power to Salvation, but as they believe and receive that Light of God and Chriſt, which they be freely enlightened withal, which ſhines in their very Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which ſearcheth their very Hearts and Reins, and maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to Man his Thoughts, and from which none can hide any thing; but all things are naked and bare before him, the Light Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> one and other, who ſearcheth the moſt hidden things of Man, and brings them forth to the Judgment of his Righteouſneſs. For though the Night may hide the Adulterer and the Thief from Man, it hides them not from God; there is one nigh in the Heart and Conſcience, that tells Man and Woman all that ever they have done, and do daily do, even their ſecret Thorghts; Is not this the Chriſt of God, the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was to come, and is come, and dwells amongſt us? And we look not for another, and of his Fulneſs have all we received, and do daily receive, who believe in his Light, which ſhines in our Hearts, according to the Scriptures of Truth. And this the Fulneſs of our Bleſſed God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the Light, is it which filleth all that come to him with all Spiritual Bleſſings, and Heavenly good Things; and without whom all is Darkneſs, Emptineſs, Death and Deſolation, as all the poor, deceived, loſt Sons and Daughters of the faln <hi>Adam</hi> do ſooner or later know, and are made to confeſs.</p>
                  <p>But bleſſed are they that conſider of things in time, and lay things, to Heart, before it be too late; <hi>For there are but Twelve Hours in a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97179:132"/>Day,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1666"/> in which Men may work,</hi> ſaith Chriff, <hi>and then the Night cometh, in which no Man can work:</hi> But the Door will be ſhut upon all who have ſlighted and neglected the Day of their Viſitation.</p>
                  <p>Oh <hi>England! England!</hi> and all Lands far and near, that you had known, or could yet believe the things that belong to your Everlaſting Peace, before they be hid from your Eyes. Therefore turn ye, turn ye at the Reproofs of God's Wiſdom and Spirit of Light and Truth, which ſounds through all, and lets you ſee the Vanity and Evil of all your Works, and Frailty of all your Lives, how ſoon the Thread of your Life is out off; and then, where are the great Emperors and Kings, with all their Crowns? And where are the great Captains and Commanders, with all their Bloody Victories? And where are the Wiſe <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s, and Cunning Counſellors of the Earth, with all their Admirers? And where are the Covetous Oppreſſors, with all their Houſes full of the Spoils of the Innocent? Yea, in that Day, where is all the Glory and Luſts of the World, with all the Lovers of it? Surely in Darkneſs and Miſery ſhall they lye down together, and Death ſhall have Dominion over them, even all who have not believed in the Light, Chriſt Jeſus, and who have not followed him in the Regeneration, that they might be ſaved; but have ſpent their Days in the Pleaſures and Luſts of the preſent Evil World to Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, O all People, Hearken to the Counſel of the Lord in this your Day, and learn of the Lamb, the Light, who calls you to Repentance from all your grievous Ways. How long ſhall the Spirit of the Lord ſtrive with you? When will you ceaſe learning <hi>War,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Spoil? O when will you beat your Swords into Plow-ſhares, and your Spears into Pruning-hooks?</hi> O when will you go and ſay one to another, one Neighbour to another, and one Nation to another, <hi>Come let us all be humbled before the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who made us all of one Blood, to dwell together upon the Face of the Earth in Truth, Goodneſs and Love to ſerve one another, and ſo as Branches of one Tree, to receive Life, and Vertue, and Power from our God into our Souls, to ſtrengthen us unto his holy Work; who came not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them; whoſe Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore is not ſet up or maintained with Carnal Weapons, Violence and Spoil; but by the Eternal Spirit of our God, whoſe Fruit is in all Goodneſs, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truth?</hi> And let not the wicked Devil, the Deſtroyer, deceive us any more by his <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Deluſions;</hi> but let us all with one Heart and Soul reſiſt his Temptations. When he perſwades us to ſeek to be great in the Earth, and be avenged on them we count our Enemies, let us not hearken to him; but let us over come their Evil with Goodneſs;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97179:132"/>and not to ſeek the Deſtruction of their Perſons, or Spoil of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> do that know not God; but let us follow the Example of Jeſus Chriſt, God manifeſt in Fleſh, who when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again, <hi>but prayed for ſuch as deſpitefully uſed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O come, let us follow this meek Lamb in Righteouſneſs and Truth, and learn of him in our Heart, who is Meek and Lowly, that we may find Reſt for our Souls; who rebuked his Diſciples, who would have had Fire to come down from Heaven to deſtroy the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that would not at that time receive Chriſt. For what knoweſt thou, O Man, but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> may in time come to a better Mind; and then thou wilt ſee it was thy Will, and not God's, that deſired their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in their Sins. For Chriſt would have all to be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of his Truth: But many will not come to him, that they might have Life, and ſo their Deſtruction is of themſelves, and their Condemnation juſt. And who are thoſe now therefore that withſtand the Doctrine of the Truth, which ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> and ſeek not the Deſtruction of their Perſons, and the Spoil of their Eſtates; but ſeek by good Doctrine and good Life, to bring them out of their Sins: And if they will not, but rather hate thee for thy good Will, be content; thou haſt quitted thy own Soul, and art clear of their Blood; and ſo thou becomeſt a Sufferer with Jeſus, Chriſt, and ſhalt Reign with him in due time. I ſay, who are theſe now on the Earth, that withſtand Truth, and continue in the hateful deſtroying Ways of the Old <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but ſuch as will not be counſelled by the Lamb of God, the Suffering Seed, who ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart:</hi> But are Men of Corrupt Minds, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Gain,</hi> and <hi>Worldly Honour,</hi> and <hi>Promotions</hi> more than Godlineſs, who cries <hi>Peace</hi> to themſelves in their Sins: And that ſame Spirit in them which crie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the Lord is ariſen to Judge all theſe Evil Things, and to Redeem a Seed to ſerve him, as in the beginning of the Goſpel, before <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> the Murderer got up amongſt them, that profeſſed Chriſt in Words, but denied him in Deeds; who had a Name that they lived but were dead from that true Life, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, whom in Words they profeſſed.</p>
                  <p>And though the Paſſage we ſeel now to be as hard of coming from amongſt the falſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as it was for the firſt true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> to come from amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet the Almighty Power of our God is able over all, and through all to carry us on to the end, whom he hath called and ſaved with a mighty Salvation (ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed

And I could deſire that all who are apt to reaſon, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, when they heard the Declaration of the Goſpel of Peace, and Kingdom of God, which ſtands in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If we let this go on, then the</hi> Romans <hi>or Others will come and take our Place and Nation.</hi> I ſay, that they would conſider, That the very Courſe which they, to wit the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Denial of the Truth took for ſaving of themſelves, brought utter Deſtruction upon them and their Nation.</p>
                  <p>But what! ſhall vain Man in his fooliſh faln Wiſdom and earthly Reaſoning, think to be Wiſer than God, and to have a greater Care and Love to the Creation, than God himſelf, who made it, hath?

                  </p>
                  <p>O Earth, Earth! Tremble before the Lord; for thou ſhalt never have Peace in thy own Ways, thou ſhalt never be Saved by thy own Strength, thou ſhalt never be Eſtabliſhed by thy own Counſels, thou ſhalt never have true Peace, nor any Plenty within thy Borders, until thou believeſt the Goſpel, which ſaith, Learn of Chriſt, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World, and whoſe Weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual, Mighty through God; not for the pulling down of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Walls and Bodies, but for razing, and pulling down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan in the Hearts and Lives of the Children of Men: <hi>For after that,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The World by Wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> (to wit, ſuch Doctrine as this, which is a Croſs and Stumbling-block to all Corrupt Fleſh) <hi>to ſave them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So lay things to heart, ye People of the World, and Inhabitants of all the Earth; for God's Purpoſe is not to exalt any Man or Men of this World, or to glorifie any Fleſh; but to exalt his own Son, Chriſt Jeſus, the heavenly Man, the Lord from Heaven, the Truth over all; of whoſe Kingdom and Government there ſhall be no End. And all that obey his Voice, and for Obedience thereunto are made willing to

Will you ſay with ſuch evil Men, that the Lord hath forſaken the Earth, and is there Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the moſt High?

Whether you Proſecute me upon <hi>Mary</hi>'s Act, or upon the Oath, you will be guilty of Evil in the ſight of God in both, for in the one you will but Imitate the Papiſts in <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days; who, by that Law, endeavoured to ſtop the Mouth of God's Witneſs againſt their Superſtitious and Idolatrous Doings: And by the other, you will make your ſelves like them whom God had taken way before you,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97179:134"/>who Perſecuted me, becauſe I could not Swear, and ſo break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, who ſaith unto his, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So conſider what you do, for it is not me, but the Truth of God in me, that you have ſet your ſelves againſt; for I would not have you deſtroy your ſelves by ſtriving againſt Gods Truth, for though I be as nothing, and you may trample upon me as a Man, yet God's Ever-bleſſed Truth, which dwells in me, and is with me, and for me in this, as in other of his Works you cannot overcome, for Truth is ſtronger than all, and hath ever been my help, when Men of Evil Minds have riſen up againſt me for Truth's Sake, I praiſe the Lord: And ſo I have found, by manifold Experience, <hi>That</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the City of Truth, hath been a burdenſome Stone to all that have fought againſt it;</hi> as ſaith Scripture, <hi>Zechariah</hi> 12.3. So if you be wiſe, you will Underſtand, and provide for your Souls Peace, by letting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent go free, and not keep him in Bondage for Pleaſing your ſelves, and the Hirelings, whom God is againſt, for it is not for their Sakes that the late wicked Popiſh Plot was diſcovered, but for God's Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed Truth's Sake, which he is purpoſed to Exalt in theſe latter Days, and for the ſake of all ſuch as love Truth in Sincerity. Reſts God's Suffering Servant, and your Friend, who am, I praiſe God, no more, nor otherwiſe a diſturber of your Peace, or the Peoples, than the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> was in his Days of that Generation, though ſo by them Accounted, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>And conſider well, in the cool of the Day, what is the reaſon that things go ſo oddly on concerning thoſe. People, called <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſeek the hurt of all, without Reſpect of Perſons or Profeſſions, who cannot bow to their Idols: Is it not your Sins, <hi>O People,</hi> and your keeping amongſt you ſo much of the Popiſh Leaven yet Unpurged out from you, as it was the Sins and Superſtitions of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, that gave the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſo much advantage againſt them. So buy of Chriſt Eye-ſalve, and annoint your Eyes with it that you may ſee, and then all things will be plain to you.</p>

Is it not high time for the Lord to lay to his Hand, ſeeing you have ſo covered his Law with your Traditions and vain Cuſtoms, that the poor People can hardly find any one thing you do, ſavouring of Pure Chriſtian Doctrine, or the Apoſtles Practice? But the Hand of the Man of Sin is the Worker in you, and by the power of the Earth is your Building upheld; But Wo to the Building which the Lord hath not builded, and Wo to the Builders of that Houſe wherein all the Wicked of the World inhabit, lye down, and are at eaſe, and bring forth their Young: Is this the Church of God? Nay, nay, this is the Synagogue of Satan, and not of the Living God, for the Houſe of God is Holy, and nothing but Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells there, nothing that defileth can enter this day into God's Temple, for Holineſs is the Ornament of God's Houſe for ever. So Wo to the falſe Builders and Daubers, that cry Peace to People in their Sins; the Lord ſpeaks no Peace to any Sinners, but Judgments, Plagues, and Woes to Prieſts and People who live in their Sins, and plead for a Continuance in Sin as long as they live, as at this day. Wo to the unſpiritual Men, that bind heavy Burdens upon others, and will not touch them with one of their Fingers; that bind the poor Men whom they call Wardens of their Church, by Oath, to do impoſſible things, and puniſh them that make Conſcience of their Ways and dare not Swear nor Forſwear, but would keep their Hearts clean to Chriſt, in whoſe Church is neither Swearing nor Forſwearing this day, but the Yea is Yea, and the Nay is Nay, in all things, in Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But Wo to the wicked World, that takes God's Name in their polluted Lips, the Lord is ariſen to judge thee in Flames of Fire, for the day of the Lord is dawned upon thee, and thy building will he thrown down, and a viſible downfall ſhall <hi>Babylon</hi> have upon the Face of all the Earth, for the Paſtors have not gathered in, nor viſited with Truth, the good Seed, but with Force and Violence over it do they Rule; and therefore is the Lord ariſen to plead the Cauſe of the Poor and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as the Mouth of the Lord hath ſaid.

                     <p>
                        <hi>RICHARD BAXTER,</hi> a Man, who through a ſhew of Learning and Religion, had gotten (in <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s Days) a great Eſteem in the Minds of the Ignorantly Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profeſſors of Religion in this Nation, and eſpecially in the Parts of <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> about <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> (where he then reſided) hath ſince the Change of the Times, and coming in of the Old Common-Prayer-Book-again, much manifeſted his Nakedneſs, Confuſion, and Unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every Eye, that in any meaſure is open to ſee the difference of Truth and Error in the ground of it, as by his Works appear: And that it is ſo, amongſt other things, that Book of his, faſly call'd, <hi>The Cure of Church-Diviſions,</hi> which I have now under-hand to Anſwer, doth plainly manifeſt: For, inſtead of Curing Diviſions, he hath ſhew'd <hi>himſelf</hi> to be a Phyſician of <hi>no Value,</hi> and ſo inſtead of <hi>Curing,</hi> hath ſtruck at (under a <hi>Judas</hi> Kiſs of Unity and Concord) the very Life and Foundation of all true Chriſtian Unity and Amity; to wit, The Free and Perfect Teachings, and Gifts, and Work of the Spirit of Truth, (the Spirit of the Father and Son in his Believing Members) whereby they cry in a ſpotleſs Mind, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and freely and powerfully declare the Glory of his Kingdom to the Children of Men; and inſtead thereof, would bring in and eſtabliſh that Soul-deceiving and Church-dividing Doctrine of Humane Learning and Humane Helps, as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the procuring and engaging, as it were, the Holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited God to give unto the Creature his Holy Spirit, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Myſteries of his Eternal Will and Kingdom for the ſame; as in Anſwer to an Objection in the 6th Page of his Book, in his firſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97179:140"/>Direction (ſo call'd) is to be ſeen. The Objection againſt his Carnal Reaſonings, for Old Men's Knowledge, is in Page 5. where he ſaith,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I know thoſe that I have to do with will ſay, That Divinity is not learn'd by Labour and Men's teaching, as other Sciences and Arts are; but by Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (I add, <hi>yea, and moſt free Gift) of the Spirit of God, and therefore the Youngeſt may have as much of it as the Eldeſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this <hi>R. B.</hi> there thus Anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. <hi>There is ſome Truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſome Falſhood, and much Confuſion in this Objection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us hear how this <hi>R. B.</hi> proves that, that there is either Falſhood or Confuſion in the Objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Saving Knowledge of Divinity muſt be taught by the Spirit of God; but it is falſe, that Labour and Humane Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are not the Means which muſt be us'd by them who will have the Teaching of the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> But O the Darkneſs, yea, rather Enmity, that is in <hi>R. B</hi>'s Heart againſt the free Teaching of God's Spirit! That he would find any thing againſt ſo plain and manifeſt Truth, as is in this Objection! But what will not Fleſh do that is lifted up with Conceits of his own Wiſdom, to keep up its Honour before the People, rather than the Pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But to this I ſay, that a Child of Light, in the leaſt Meaſure, doth eaſily ſee the Falſhood of that Spirit, by which this <hi>R. B.</hi> is acted in this his Anſwer: For the Wind of the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, thou natural Man; but neither knows whence it comes, nor whither it goes; ſo is every one that is Born of God: And without this Birth, all thy Knowledge is Damning, not Saving, <hi>John</hi> 3.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 32.7.8. <hi>I ſaid, Days ſhould Speak, and multitude of Years ſhould Teach Wiſdom: But there is a Spirit in Man; and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them underſtanding.</hi> And ſaith God, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt Days, that I will pour out my Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Fleſh; and they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97179:140"/>and ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, as his Predeceſſors of Old, the <hi>Phariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But what is that Labour and Humane Means that People muſt uſe for getting the Spirit of God, or Saving Knowledge of Divinity, as he calls it? Is it tumbling over a Ruck of Books, ſtuffed with Art and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wiſdom, or Learning from below, as this <hi>R. B.</hi> hath long done, to the darkning of his Heart from the Knowledge of God, and Way of his Spirit; ſo that he knows nothing of it, after all his long loſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but what he knows naturally, as a Brute Beaſt (and that's plain) for it ſanctifies him not, as by his confeſſing, That his beſt Duties, even his Prayers, are not without Sin; and affirming, That no Man prays without Sin? As in his Book is to be ſeen, Page 195. and in his Preface.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the Prayer of Faith, and Preaching by the Spirit, he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; yea, Preaching by the Spirit is become a Mock and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion to him and his Brethren at this Day: But <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, Magnifie the Free Grace and Infinite Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, according to that (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) ſaying, <hi>Not that we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of our ſelves to think a good Thought; but our Ability is of God, who hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter kills, but the Spirit gives Life: And that which the Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath entred into the Heart of Man</hi> (or Humane Heart) <hi>to conceive, hath God reveal'd to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the Deep Things of God; and which Things we Preach or Speak not in the words which Man's (or Humane) Wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>R. B.</hi> comparing Spiritual Things with Carnal, is not wiſe, who, becauſe Old Men, and long Students in Arts and worldly Sciences, are moſt Wiſe, or likely to be ſo; therefore they that Labour and Study moſt in Books of Divinity (ſo call'd) get moſt of the Spirit's Teaching.</p>
                     <p>O ſad! that ever the Minds of the Children of Men ſhould be ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Darkneſs, and yet read the Scripture of Truth, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to no one thing more than to the Free Teachings of the Spirit of God, without Humane Helps! For all the Help that is Humane, or that Man who is (<hi>ab humo,</hi> that is) <hi>from the Earth</hi> can afford, is but Natural, and of this World, which comes to nought; therefore is it ſaid, That none of the Princes (that is, the Chief Men) of this World knew the Myſtery of Chriſt and his Kingdom then, which made
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97179:141"/>them ſo Band againſt him, ſee the 2d <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And the Natural Man, with all his Natural Means, diſcerns not the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern'd: So every one that would know the Mind of the Spirit of God, muſt come to feel (through the Moſt Holy Faith) a meaſure of it in themſelves: <hi>For, after ye believ'd, ye were Seal'd with the Spirit of Promiſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> And the Word is nigh thee, even in thy Heart and Mouth: O thou that haſt an Ear to hear, hear what the Spirit ſpeaks, even the Word of Faith, which we Preach: Therefore go not forth from the Anointing of God in thy Heart, to hear the frothy and falſe Doctrine of ſuch as <hi>R. B.</hi> who have run and ſet up themſelves by their Humane Helps, in the Place of Teachers, and God never ſent them, and therefore they cannot profit the People at all; but lead them about, like ſilly Women, laden with divers Sins and Luſts; yea, in their Prayers and beſt Performances, as is manifeſt; and ſo, not being ſent and enabled by God's Spirit, they can never lead you to it, but from it, as is manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>R. B.</hi> in Page 6. before-mention'd, ſaith, <hi>The Objection hath much Confuſion in it.</hi> (And how proves he that? But by ſaying) 1. <hi>It confoundeth the Spirit's teaching us, by inditing the Scripture with the Spirit's teaching us the meaning of the Scriptures.</hi> 2. <hi>And it confoundeth the Common Knowledge of Divinity, with the Saving Knowledge of it. No Man cometh to a Common Knowledge, fit for a Teacher of others, without the Spirit's teaching by the Scriptures; for that was the firſt part of the Spirit's teaching us, to inſpire the Prophets and Apoſtles, to deliver a Teaching Word to the Churches, by which we might all be taught of God through all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But many Men have Excellent Common Knowledge by this Word, and by the Common Help of the Spirit, without that Special Help, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth Saving Knowledge: And all Knowledge requireth Time and Labour to obtain it, though the Spirit giveth it, and though it may be ſanctified to us in a little time; but that may be a means of ſaving others, which ſaveth not the Man that hath it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in Page 114. farther ſaith, <hi>Take them not for no Miniſters that want Grace totally: And marvel not that Gifts are more neceſſary to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Miniſtration, than Grace is; he may perform the Office of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Benefit of the Church, that hath no Saving Grace at all.</hi> Thus far <hi>R. B.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O! What Sorcery and <hi>Egyptian</hi>-darkneſs is here, to make void the New Covenant, and Free Gracious Teachings of the Spirit of God in theſe Days, and to Eſtabliſh the Letter in the room and ſtead thereof, which only witneſſes to is, and is a Declaration concerning what the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97179:141"/>Spirit of God did in them, and in the World before Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, and what was done during his being in it, and what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would do in the Believing Souls, and in the World after that time? But this the Hirelings do, that they by their trading with, and giving their falſe meanings upon the Scriptures, they may keep the People in Blindneſs, and ſo from the Anointing, and Teaching, and Enjoyment of that Spirit that was in them that gave forth Scriptures, that they may not ſee their deceitful Doctrines and Merchandizes, leſt they ſhould buy no more of them: For no Man that knows the badneſs of <hi>Babylon</hi> will buy them any more, and then will the Merchants of Souls mourn: For, they that know the Lord, and his Spirit's Teaching in them, which is the Good Old Way, yea, and the ever New, Freſh, Profitable, and Living VVAY, will follow no more ſuch Men, as would bring in, and eſtabliſh a Graceleſs Miniſtry, as this <hi>R. B.</hi> doth here, to his Shame. But ſuch Graceleſs Prieſts the Lord will have none of; nor his People neither: <hi>For my Sheep hear my Voice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and a ſtranger they will not hear:</hi> Surely a Graceleſs Man is this Stranger: <hi>They</hi> (to wit, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Men, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.) <hi>are of the World, and the World hear them; we are of God; Stewards of the manifold Grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. And they that are of God hear us.</p>
                     <p>And ſo, Ever Bleſs'd and Prais'd be the Great and Glorious Name of the Lord Jeſus, who hath reſtor'd to them that Obey him, the Glorious Doctrine of the Spirit's Teaching, as was in the Apoſtles Days, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his true Promiſe; where all in the Truth (of which we, the People of God, in Scorn call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> are Members) is done in and by the Holy Spirit, prais'd be God; and nothing own'd amongſt us, but what is ſo done: Here is Praying in and by the Spirit, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and by the Spirit, and Singing in and by the Spirit of our Holy Lord God; and ſo the Head being Spiritual, and the Members of the Body every one Spiritual, (for we are all Baptized by one Holy Spirit into the one Heavenly Body) our Food is alſo Spiritual Heavenly Bread, and Heavenly Wine, and the Water Spiritual that ſanctifies us, and mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

B.</hi> doth; and ſo they having gotten a little Brain-knowledge
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97179:142"/>by their Humane Helps, and not by the Spirit of Truth, they wreſt Scripture to their own and others Deſtruction, deſiring and boaſting themſelves to be Maſters and Teachers of others, whilſt themſelves need teaching what the very Principles, or beginning Doctrines of the true Chriſtian Religion is, as is plainly manifeſted by his ſeeking to bring in a graceleſs Miniſter, or Wolf into Chriſt's Fold, ſurely the Wolf comes not but to rob and deſtroy. <hi>All that ever came before me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are Thieves and Robbers, and never came in by the Door,</hi> as its plain, the Graceleſs Man doth not, but hath climb'd up another way by his Humane Helps, as <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks; and to this purpoſe, ſee <hi>John</hi> the 10th, and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. where Chriſt at large ſets forth ſuch Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Teachers; who can perk themſelves up in Places of Teachers, by the World's help outwardly; but <hi>will neither enter into the Kingdom of God themſelves, nor ſuffer others, but ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men,</hi> by ſuch deceitful Doctrine and Antichriſtian Inventions, as this <hi>R. B.</hi> hath, by ſaying, <hi>That Gifts are more neceſſary to the validity of Miniſtration, than Grace is;</hi> and that he may perform the Office of a Miniſter to the Benefit of the Church, that hath no Saving Grace at all; <hi>And all Knowledge requireth Time and Labour to obtain it, though the Spirit giveth it;</hi> which laſt ſaying doth directly thwart and contradict the Scripture; which ſaith, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not,</hi> Iſa. 65.1. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſets believing and working in this great Matter of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Chriſt to Salvation, one againſt the other, as the way of the Law and Goſpel; <hi>for to him that worketh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the Reward reckon'd of Debt, not Gift of Grace; but to him that Believeth it is of Grace, to the Glory of God's great Love to Man;</hi> for ſaith the Scripture, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son, that whoſoever on him believe, ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have Life Eternal:</hi> And none can truly ſay, but thoſe are the beſt knowers, and wiſeſt People, that have Eternal Life in them, though they never laboured for it, nor ſought for it; and ſo ſuch as this <hi>R.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97179:142"/>and loſt Labour, having gotten a little or a great deal of talk from the Letter of the Scripture concerning Religion, in their Earthly Spirits, which ſees nothing of the Kingdom of God; they condemn the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Juſt, whom God teacheth and Bleſſeth with all Spiritual Knowledge in Heavenly Things, and call <hi>them Spiritually Proud;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot but ſpeak very highly, and yet in the trueſt humility of Heart, concerning the great Things that God hath done for their Souls; and becauſe they cannot join with the Wicked whom God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth, neither in their Worſhip, nor other ſinful Cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>And ſo out of that Old Bottel, come all thoſe unſavoury Expreſſions of <hi>R.

                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, That pretending we deny, and truly ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>That God who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give us</hi> (yea, moſt freely without our own La-Labour, or any Humane Help) <hi>The Knowledge of the Glory of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and thoſe that call this Doctrine, either in the Apoſtle, or us, a Patronizing of Sloth and Idleneſs, are thoſe that do really Blaſpheme God's Spirit which teacheth it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But many Texts</hi> (ſaith <hi>R. B.</hi>) <hi>commands us diligence; and ſloth is a great Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I ſay, the Scripture indeed commands a diligent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and holy Exerciſe of the free Gifts which the Spirit hath given the Faithful: But the Scripture never ſaid, that Humane Labour and Helps are the Means to be uſed for getting the Spirit's Teachings; and without which no Knowledge in Spiritual Matters is now received; <hi>Stir up the Gift of God in thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſo ſay I; but he no where puts the Humane or Carnal Man to Work or Labour to get the Spirit; for that is quite contrary to this Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. as alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But this <hi>R. B.</hi> asks this Queſtion, <hi>Why hath God ſetled a Teaching Office in his Church, and commanded all to attend, and hear, and learn, if we are taught by the Spirit without Man's help? Why were the Apoſtles ſent forth into all the World,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Here is the great ſtumbling of theſe Unbelievers, (the Worldly-wiſe Ones indeed) what, becauſe God in his free unlimited Spirit did begift Men, and in his own Spiritual Power ſent them forth to preach and publiſh all abroad the Glory of his Kingdom, and Good
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97179:143"/>Will to Men; cannot People therefore be taught by the Spirit without Man's help? What Reaſoning's this? When the Scripture expreſly ſaith, That all the Gifts, and Abilities, Helps, and Means of bringing People to God, and the Knowledge, and Enjoyment of all the Good Things of his Kingdom, are meerly, ſolely, and wholly from God and his Bleſſed Spirit's free Gift in Chriſt, and not from Man at all: And therefore, when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> began to look at Man, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> he calls it Carnal, and ſaid, Chriſt was not divided, ſignifying plainly it was Chriſt, and the Spirit of his Power, that alone did all in all; as Chriſt ſaid. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>Without me you can do nothing;</hi> for in the True Church Chriſt ever was, and ever will be all in all, and and Man nothing; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Paul is nothing:</hi> But in the Falſe Church where <hi>R.

                     </p>
                     <p>But what ſottiſhneſs is this in <hi>R.

                     <p>But whereas thou addeſt and ſaid, <hi>Thoſe are taught of God, who are taught by thoſe who are ſent of God to be their Teachers;</hi> it plainly ſhews the numerous Company thou boaſts of, who believe thee, are not taught of God; for thy Doctrine already mentioned, ſhews moſt plainly that thou waſt never ſent of God; for never did any, whom God ſent ſet themſelves againſt the Free and Gracious Teaching and Gifts of God's Spirit, to Eſtabliſh Humane Helps, as thou doſt: But as if that which thou haſt ſaid were nothing, thou addeſt, Page 8.</p>

                        <hi>Adviſe with the Experience of all the World; who was the Man that ever you knew, able to Expound one Chapter in the Bible by the inward Teachings of the Spirit alone, without any Labour of his own, or Help from others by Voice or Writing? Where dwelleth the Man, who by meer Inſpiration can turn one Chapter out of the Hebrew or Greek into the Vulgar Tongue? And where is the Man that can ſolidly unfold any Doctrine of Divinity, which he never read or heard of, or can Teach that Truth, and deny that Religion which he was never taught by Man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And afterwards in his Second Direction, and Page 16. having led his wretched Diſciples into a Labyrinth or Miſt of words, about their Uncertainties in their Matters of Knowledge; and having adviſed them to Humility, as he calls it, or not to think too highly of their own Knowledge; he there adds, and ſays in that 16th Page eſpecially, <hi>If you know your Advantages for Knowledge have been leſs than other Mens, that you are young; or that it is but a few Years ſince you entred upon the Study of the Scriptures; or that you have not any ſtronger Natural Parts than other Men; that you have not had that Meaſure of Learning which might further your Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; but that others that differ from you have had much more of all theſe Helps and Means than you, and have Prayed more, and Meditated more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And in Page 17. in his Anſwer to an Objection; which is, <hi>That the Learnedſt Men are not always the Wiſeſt in the Matters of Religion;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>many Men are learned in the Languages and Sciences, who are not learned in the Scripture; becauſe they applied not their Studies that way; and many Men are learned in the Scriptures and Sacred Languages, who yet live in Sin, though they are able to Teach the Truth, for others:</hi> Here (by the way) all may take notice what a Falſe Teacher this <hi>R. B.</hi> is, who is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay, <hi>That Man that lives in Sin, may Teach the Truth for others;</hi> for ſuch as live in Sin, neither know the Truth (which is Chriſt) nor have ſeen him, (as <hi>John</hi>'s firſt Epiſt. Chap 3. expreſly ſaith) but this <hi>R. B.</hi> goeth on, and ſaith, <hi>But thoſe that well underſtand the Scriptures without learning the Languages which they are written in, and the Cuſtoms of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97179:144"/>thoſe Times and Countries, or without much reading, and long Study of the Scriptures themſelves, and the Writings of them that better underſtand them, are ſo few, if any at all; that if you will pretend to be one of them, you had need of ſome Miracle, or ſomething like a Miracle, to make your ſelves or others believe that you are not deceived.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might here add his other falſe Doctrines immediately following theſe in that his Book, as his Anſwer to an Objection there ſet down againſt Singularity, or ſo; the Objection is this, <hi>The greater Number are not always in the Right; therefore why ſhould my Singularity diſcourage me.</hi> But becauſe his Anſwer hath a pretty many words in it, I refer it to another place, and to what he hath already ſaid, do Anſwer, and ſay in breif thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That as by his other words, ſo alſo by theſe, it is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from what Fountain this <hi>R. B</hi>'s knowledge hath proceeded, to wit, not from the Inſpiration of the Eternal Spirit, which gave forth Scripture; but from his own Earthly or Natural Spirit and Humane Induſtry and Studies, and Trading in Books and Letters without him, from which earthly or humane Spirit and Wiſdom hath not come (nor poſſible ever can come to any) the right Meaning and Underſtanding of Holy Scripture (as ſuch as he would have it) <hi>For the natural Man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>perceiveth not the things that be of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. But all falſe Viſions, and lying Divinations have ever come from that earthly Spirit, and all the cruel Wreſtings of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, from the beginning to this Day, have proceeded from it, to the miſerable and woful Undoing of the Generality of that People, called <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> as alſo the Blood-ſheds, and all the cruel Uſage of Spiritual-minded Men, for their pure Conſcience Sake, have iſſued from that Fountain of the Earthly Spirits, and the falſe Births thereof, from the beginning, and that great Whore found Guilty of all; for in her was found the Blood of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were Slain upon the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.24. For what Spiritual Man did ever ask ſuch a Queſtion, or rather affirm; for in him, his queſtion is an Affirmation, to wit, <hi>That no man is able, by the inward Teachings of the Spirit alone, to Expound one Chapter in the Bible: And that there is none can ſolidly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfold any Doctrine of Divinity, which he never Read or Heard of, or can teach the Truth, or defend that Religion, which he was never taught by Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh happy therefore are they who are come to the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, and to know the inward Teachings and Leadings of his Holy Spirit in their Heart, to lead them into all Truth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 16. without being beholding to vain Man's Help; for whereof is he to be accounted, as is manifeſt, even as a thing of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97179:144"/>naught, is the beſt of them, out of the Truth: For O! How Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Miniſtry of God and Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit's Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſufficient Teaching, is this <hi>R. B.</hi> who is not content to fit among the Pariſh-Teachers, as a Fellow; but even takes upon him to be a Teacher of the Teachers? Yea, ſo Ignorant and Unbelieving is he, concerning the Spirit's Power and Sufficiency in theſe Days, that without an outward Miracle, he will not believe any ſuch thing: Nay, he would not have People believe for themſelves, that God teacheth their own Hearts, unleſs it comes in Man's Way, and by humane Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Labour, and natural Means: Therefore the Lord ſaw good for his own Glory, and for the Vindication of his own Honourable and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Truth, which the Hirelings had made void by their Traditions; and for the abſolute neceſſity of his own beloved Seed, to reſtore unto us the Ancient Doctrine of the Holy Spirit's Sufficiency, in all the Work of bringing Man out of the Fall to God, that the Lord, the Spirit, might be the firſt and the laſt; yea, all in all, in their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without Man's help; for he is worthy, who, as he Created all things, by his own alone Power, and according to his good Will; ſo he Reſtores all things, according to the Counſel of his own Will, and not of Fleſh, nor of Blood, nor of the Will of Man, as the Apoſtle alſo Speaks, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. But, Oh! How unlike is this Doctrine of the Apoſtles, to <hi>R. B</hi>'s; for when the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>To them that received Chriſt, to them he gave Power to become the Sons of God;</hi> leſt any ſhould think, as this <hi>R. B.</hi> doth, that it was either by Man's Labour or Study, or humane Endeavour, or Art, or Parts, or any Natural Abilities or Helps whatſoever; he ſaith, <hi>It was not of Fleſh, nor of Blood, nor of the Will of Man, but of God. And of his own Will begat he us, by the Word of Truth,</hi> ſaith that other Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17, 18. And he bids not <hi>Err,</hi> as this <hi>R. B.</hi> doth, to ſet up another Fountain or Root; and that this Word of Truth is not any outward Writing, Voice, or any Creature: <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Chapter tells us, <hi>That in the beginning was this Word, and the Word was with God, and is God: And his Name is called, the Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19.13. So this Word, though it works according to the Witneſs of the Scripture, which it gave forth freely, and as it ſelf pleaſeth, in the Children of Men; yet it is not the Scripture; <hi>For ſearch the Scriptures, or ye do ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that witneſs of me, but you will not come to me that you may have Life;</hi> and theſe were they that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He bore them Record that they had a Zeal for God (and Scripture) but not according to Knowledge;</hi> for they being Ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, went about to Eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and ſubmitted not to God's: And ſo, even ſo this <hi>R. B.</hi> and many ſuch like, have a blind Zeal,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97179:145"/>and a great Talk of the Scriptures without, and of the Spirits Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Letter, and humane Helps, and the like; but will not come to Chriſt, to know him in them, that they may have Life, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Righteouſneſs: But would Eſtabliſh their own, which is meer Emptineſs and Vanity in the ſight of God, and all truly Spiritual Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.</p>
                     <p>And how far this <hi>R. B</hi>'s Language in thoſe other words, where he ſaith, <hi>That if any will pretend to a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Scriptures, without learning the Languages which they are written in, and the Cuſtoms of thoſe Times, Countries, or without much Reading, and long Study of the Scriptures themſelves, and the Writings of them that better underſtand them, had need of ſome Miracle, or ſomething like a Miracle, to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or others, that they are not deceived.</hi> How far, I ſay, is this Doctrine and Language in this <hi>R. B.</hi> from the Language of the Holy Men of God that writ the Scripture, let the Spiritual Man, who beſt underſtands all things, Judge; for the Holy Apoſtles Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the free Grace, and the free Teachings of the Spirit of Grace, and debaſed Man, and all meer humane Helps, as is ſaid before, and as the Scripture Witneſſeth: But this <hi>R. B.</hi> tyeth the weight and main Streſs of all, upon humane Learning, natural Parts, knowledge of Cuſtom and Countries, much Reading, long Study, and the like; inſomuch, that without them, Man muſt not look that any ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him: Nay, nor he muſt not own God's Teaching in his own Heart without theſe; unleſs ſeconded by ſome Miracle, or the like.</p>
                     <p>But, Oh the Miſery thereof of ſuch poor Souls, as follow ſuch wretched Teachers, and their unſound Doctrine, as I may well ſay; And Oh! for ever Bleſſed are they who are brought from off ſuch Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Mountains into the good Fold, where all the Lambs of Chriſt lye down in the good Paſture of the Spirit's Fulneſs; and walk up and down in the Light of the Lord, under the Hand of the good Shepherd, Chriſt Jeſus, where none can come to make afraid, nor deceive; for in the Light of our God, we ſee all theſe falſe Teachers, and their devouring Doctrines; and by the Holy Power of God are delivered from them, and made able in the overcoming Spirit of Truth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt them: Glory to God for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again let us review, and conſider in particular a little of thoſe words of his, before ſet down; where he ſaith, as an Argument to perſwade his young Ones, and Diſſenters, to his falſly called Humility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If you know your Advantages for Knowledge, have been leſs than other Men's; that you are younger, or that it is but a few Years ſince you entered upon the Study of the Scripture; or that you have not any ſtronger Natural Parts than other Men; or that you have not had that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97179:145"/>Meaſure of Learning, which might further your Knowledge of the Holy Scripture: But that others, that differ from you, have had much more of all theſe Helps and Means than you; and have Prayed more, and Meditated more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To which I Anſwer, That by theſe words it is eaſily ſeen, what manner of Knowledge it is that this <hi>R. B.</hi> trades in, and would have all Slaves unto; and what are his Means for obtaining it; to wit, a meer natural Knowledge; which, by meer worldly Helps and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, may be attained: For a meer Heathen accompanied with many Years, and much humane Learning, and ſtrong Natural Parts, that can but talk much of the Scripture; eſpecially having on him a Form of Prayer, and the like, muſt needs go for a better knowing Chriſtian with him, than the deareſt Child of God; eſpecially if he be young in Years, and want thoſe natural Helps, and outward Appearances.</p>
                     <p>Oh what havock hath ſuch Doctrine, as this of <hi>R. B</hi>'s made amongſt his deluded Hearers and Admirers in this Nation; ſo that now, let the Man God come to one of them in the pureſt Evidence, and moſt powerful Demonſtration of the Spirit of Truth, if he appear not to them Cloathed and Accompanied with theſe Natural and Worldly Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Indowments; they are fenced againſt the Lord's Meſſenger with ſuch Arguments as theſe, <hi>You are but young; you have but Studied a while; you are of ſlender and mean Natural Parts; and little or no Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-ſhip, and have Prayed but little,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in compariſon of our Grave and Learned Divines, and the like:</hi> So that as Chriſt ſaid, ſo we find now true: <hi>That</hi> Publicans <hi>and</hi> Harlots <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God before ſuch;</hi> and now what a Curer of Church-diviſions this <hi>R. B.</hi> is like to prove is eaſily ſeen; and therefore that Charge, which his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned Heart fear'd would come upon him, may juſtly be brought upon him here; which, in his Preface to his Book, he ſets down thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They will affirm,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I have clawed with one Party, and have girded at the other, and have ſought to make them Odious, by bringing them under the Reproach of Separation, of cenſuring and avoiding the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly; and that, being Luke-warm my ſelf, and a Complier with Sin, I would have others to do ſo too: And that theſe Reconcilers are neither Fleſh nor Fiſh; and attempt Impoſſibilities, even to Reconcile Light and Darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial, and that for the ſake of Peace, we would ſell the Truth, and would let in Church-Corruptions, out of an over-eager deſire of Agreement; and when they have all done, neither Parties will regard them.</hi> Theſe are this <hi>R. B</hi>'s words, in that Preface of his to that Book; which is juſtly come upon him.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, he may as well go about to reconcile Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as bring the Children of Light, whom God hath delivered out
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97179:146"/>of the Darkneſs and Filthineſs of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> Spiritual, into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them again; for there is Enmity put between the two Seeds, and thoſe words of Chriſt, in <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22, &amp;c. which he deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully puts in the Title Page of his Book, are only proper to the Living Members of the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, (which he calls Myſtical) and not to any of the World's Churches, or viſible mixt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of People whatſoever; the Words of the Apoſtle in <hi>John</hi> 17.21, &amp;c. are weightier than any Hypocrite can bear, and they are theſe, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that thou alſo may be one in us; that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me; and the Glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made Perfect in one; and that the World may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi> God is ariſen to drive Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites from under all ſuch ſhelter of words, as they would hide themſelves under; for now is the City and Kingdom truly Manifeſted and Witneſſed, into which no Uncircumciſed or Unclean ſhall enter; but only the Redeemed Born babes, and Living Members of Chriſt. And now to the Knowledge and Experience, not of the Evil World, but of all that know God, do I appeal to Judge, whether this <hi>R. B.</hi> or any of like Spirit with him, can be ſaid to know any thing of the Oneneſs betwixt the Father and Son, the Members of the Holy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Body, much leſs can be any of them, who are not afraid to affirm, <hi>That ſuch are not to be diſallowed from being Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; though they want Grace totally: And that Gifts are more neceſſary to the validity of Miniſtration, than Grace is; and that he may perform the Office of a Miniſter, to the Benefit of the Church, that hath no ſaving Grace at all,</hi> (as Page 114. of his Book aforementioned) <hi>and that there is no Man alive that Worſhippeth God, without ſome Sin:</hi> And adds, <hi>Do you ever Pray your ſelves in Secret, or in your Families without Sin;</hi> as in Page 19.5.</p>
                     <p>And in Page 30. of his Preface to that Book, <hi>That there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Church or Worſhip on Earth faultleſs, and without Corruption;</hi> (and ſaith there further) <hi>I Juſtifie not the Faults of my own daily Prayers, and yet I never Pray without them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in Page 34. &amp;c. <hi>That</hi> Cain <hi>was the Firſt-born Member in the Church of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Family: And Curſed</hi> Cham <hi>was of the Church of</hi> Noah: <hi>And reckons</hi> Lot<hi>'s two Sons-in-law, and</hi> Eſau; <hi>yea, and the Ten Tribes in their Apoſtacy, to be of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo having reckoned up, and raked together the Faults of the Race of <hi>Abraham,</hi> before Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, and of thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after that mentioned in Scripture; he wickedly and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97179:146"/>imprudently ſays, Page 44. <hi>That no one Member is in all theſe Scriptures, or any other, commanded to come out, and ſeparate from any one of all theſe Churches; as if their Communion in Worſhip were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful;</hi> Directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4, 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Come out of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> Babylon <hi>(the falſe Church)</hi> ſaith God to his People.</p>
                     <p>Oh the Blaſphemy of ſuch Men's Hearts, that dare Intitle wicked Men (for a bare Profeſſion-ſake of Religion) to the Glory of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Prayer of Chriſt's, who Prays (and his Prayers were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard) <hi>That his might be one, as He and the Father were, and are one; the Father in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them;</hi> and ſo made Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs and Partakers of the Glory of Chriſt by free Gift: But neither <hi>R.

                     <p>And ſo I return to ſet down <hi>R. B</hi>'s Unchriſtian Anſwer to that former Objection againſt the Singularity of Separation; the Objection is as before; <hi>The greater Number are not always in the right; therefore, why ſhould my Singularity diſcourage me?</hi>

                     <p>Now to this <hi>R.

                        <hi>And if in any Integral or Accidental Point, you think you are wiſer than the greater part of Men, as Learned and as Godly as your ſelves, you muſt give very good Proofs of it, to your ſelves and others, before it is to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: I know that in all Ages God giveth ſome few Men more excellent Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts than others; and he engageth ſome in deeper and more laborious Studies than others; and he Bleſſeth ſome Men's Studies more than others; and therefore there are ſtill ſome few who know more than the reſt of the Country, or Mankind; and it were well for the reſt if they knew theſe, and would learn of them: But theſe are ſuch as come to their Knowledge by hard and laborious Studies, and Meditation; though alſo by the Spirits Bleſſing

                     <p>To which, by way of reply, I anſwer and ſay, That there is not the leaſt Child of Light, but doth truly and eaſily ſee the nature of the Spirit, by which this <hi>R. B.</hi> is ſtill acted, and the end he drives at; for as for the Spirit by which he is acted, it ſtill appears plainly to be the Spirit of this World that never knew God, nor the Myſteries of his Holy and Heavenly Kingdom, by which Earthly Spirit (by much poring on Books without him) he hath attained to a deal of Unſanctified Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Knowledge, (as himſelf ſpeaks Page 114.) to deceive the ſimple People by, who are Ignorant of Satan's Devices; and as for his end, it is alſo as manifeſt to be this, to wit, to bring People (who were in ſome meaſure preſſing out of <hi>Babylon</hi>) back into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> again; and yet to cover his Deceit, leſt the Simple ſhould ſee him without an Interpreter, he brings in the Spirit, as to help his Humane Labour and Carnal Endeavours: But the Spirit of God, which he ſtrikes at in all his Writing, will be no Drudge or Slave to any ſuch Vain Self-ended Proud Mind in any.</p>
                     <p>But of theſe words, where he ſaith, <hi>That all Godly Men and Chriſtians are in the right, in all Points Eſſential to Godlineſs and Chriſtianity; and therefore in the certain Way of Life,</hi> as he ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider; As for Godly Men, who ever imagined otherwiſe? much leſs denied it in words that they were in the right way; but as for that he ſaith, <hi>That all Chriſtians, if he means all that were ſprinkled when they were Children, and that ſo being grown up, make an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt</hi> (for ſuch in Spiritual manner he ſeems to mean by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) <hi>are in the right, in all Points eſſential to Chriſtianity, and ſo in the certain Way of Life.</hi> It is ſuch a notorous Expreſſion, and ſo bold an Aſſertion, that no one Saying can more gratifie the Devil, and ſo help to build up his Kingdom, than it doth: Nay, it certainly gives the Lye to the certain Experience and Teſtimony of all the Holy Men of God, both formerly and now; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in his day, <hi>That many profeſſed,</hi> and nominal Chriſtians do ſo walk, <hi>as that they were Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe God was their Belly, and who gloried in their Shame, and whoſe end was Deſtruction,</hi> Phil. 3. and were theſe in the right Points Eſſential to Chriſtianity, and in the certain way of Life? What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Blaſphemy is this? And the ſame Apoſtle tells ſome among the <hi>Corinthians, That they had not the Knowledge of God,</hi> Cor. 15. and what, Were theſe right alſo in all Eſſentials? What is not the Knowledge of God an Eſſential Point of Chriſtianity? Nay, without
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97179:147"/>the Knowledge of God, no Eternal Life; and yet this <hi>R. B.</hi> is not aſhamed to affirm, <hi>That ſuch as know not God, are in the certain Way of Life.</hi> And further, To the Experience of all that know God do I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, whether this <hi>R. B.</hi> doth not here in his blindneſs, juſtifie the very <hi>Papiſt;</hi> Yea, and all other ſorts of People, who any way in the outward profeſs Chriſt; eſpecially if they be outwardly ſprinkled with Water, young or old: For, ſaith he, in his Preface, Page 33. <hi>Chriſt hath ſolemnly and purpoſely made the Baptiſmal Covenanting with him (to wit,</hi> by outward Waſhing) <hi>to be the Term and Title to Church-Memberſhip and Communion, and the owning of this ſame Covenant, is the ſufficient Title of the Adult (or thoſe of ripe Years) and the Impoſers that come after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire another kind of Evidence of Converſion or Sanctification than this, do confound the Church, and enſlave the People, and leave no certain way of Tryal.</hi> Thus far <hi>R. B.</hi> by which it appears whither he, by endeavouring to keep his Credit with the World, is wandred beyond the Bounds of Reaſon. Nay, Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> her ſelf (though ſhe be become a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird, and a very Habitation of Devils,) ſeems juſtified by his Poſition, and reckoned to be right in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtianity, and in the certain Way of Life: For without all Controverſie, this Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> is of that Number who in words profeſs God and Chriſt, and have a Name to live, though they be dead, or it were not a Myſtery, if it were not covered from the World's Eye, with a ſhew of what it is not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 18, 19 Chapters. Yet ſo far is this <hi>R. B.</hi> in the Dark, that he accounts it an Abuſe, and falſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of Scripture, to perſwade any by that Command <hi>[Come out of Babylon]</hi> to ſeparate from profeſſed or nominal Chriſtians, though full of Iniquity, Page 32. than which, nothing more can gratifie the Wicked One, and that Adulterous Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for though he would ſeem in ſome words, here and there, in his Book, to be no <hi>Papiſt;</hi> yet there is never an Argument he brings, for the Fellowſhip with Dead and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Members; and againſt thoſe that ſeparate from ſuch; but they will fully ſerve to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be a Church, and all them to blame who have ſeparated from him in outward Church-Fellowſhip upon any Pretence whatſoever. So fooliſh is the World's Wiſdom when it is ſet againſt Truth: But this <hi>R. B.</hi> having laid his wrong Ground; <hi>That all that are called Chriſtians are in the right, in all Points eſſential to Chriſtianity, and in the certain Way of Life; he may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that to be unwarrantable Separation which goeth from ſuch.</hi> But then I ſay, How will the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> warrant their firſt Separation from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?</hi> Or how did this <hi>R. B.</hi> with his <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, with their <hi>Directory,</hi> excuſe their ſeparating from the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and their <hi>Common-prayer?</hi> And how will he ſalve his old Non-conforming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97179:148"/>Flight into <hi>New-England</hi> (where ſince they have ſhed the Blood of certain Martyrs of Chriſt) from the former <hi>Biſhops?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now his falſe Ground and Foundation being overturned, it is moſt manifeſt that that Separation is moſt lawful, which is from ſuch, who call Good Evil, and Evil Good, put Light for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light, as the Wicked do, from whom the People of God in theſe days ſeparate: And ſo in obeying the Voice of our God, who ſaith, <hi>Come out of Myſtery</hi> Babylon <hi>my People, leſt ye partake of her Sins, and ſo of her Plagues,</hi> (we are juſtified) for the Sins of the Wicked, (who, in words, profeſs God and Chriſt, but in Deeds deny all) is reached Heaven at this day: And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If any Man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolator</hi> (and Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by the Apoſtle's Doctrine, is Idolatry) <hi>or a Railer, or a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch not to keep company, no not as to eat with them,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.11.</p>
                     <p>And doth he not ſay in another place, <hi>Have no Fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs (nor with the unfruitful Workers in Darkneſs,</hi> as before) <hi>but rather reprove them,</hi> Eph. 5.14. muſt we not yet ſeparate from them, yea, yea, in their very Worſhip-Actions as well as others; and when even the greater number are ſo far defiled and tainted with the Leproſie of Unrighteouſneſs; and they are ſo far from amending, that they perſecute all that will not be as bad as themſelves: Surely when the Lord hath ſpued out a People, as he threatned to do luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3.16. yea, and caſt them off, for their reſiſting of his good Spirit, as he did the <hi>Jews;</hi> 'tis no time for his People to ſtay amongſt them then, and to continue with them in their Worſhip-Actions, as he calls them; but every one to deliver his own Soul, by coming out of ſuch Babyloniſh Worſhips; whoſe Prayers are Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, as all ſinful Prayers are; and neither this <hi>R. B.</hi> nor any one that he knoweth upon the Earth, prayeth without Sin, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before hath confeſſed; and ſo all of them together do daily and continually that which they ſhould not do, and leave undone what the Lord commands them, and ſo have no Health in them: And ſo now that the True Light ſhines ſo clear again from under the long Cloud of Antichriſtian Apoſtacy, it is the Wiſdom of all that love God and their own Souls, to joyn to the Lord in the Covenant of his Light and Spirit, where no Committers of Sin can joyn; for Darkneſs, and the Workers thereof, can never joyn with the Light, and the Workers thereof: So now that the Trumpet hath founded, all ought to come to the Holy Worſhip of God, amongſt the Holy Worſhippers, that Worſhip in the Spirit of Holineſs and Truth; (where no Worker of Iniquity, nor Hypocrite can come) out of all the Defiled Worſhip of the World
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97179:148"/>whatſoever, or under what Name ſoever in the Fall: But this <hi>R. B.</hi> is in ſuch love of Hypocriſie, that he makes a Neceſſity of the Hypocrites being amongſt the true Members of Chriſt, as though they knew not how to do without them; as if the good Corn could not grow ſo well if the Weeds were wanting; ſaying, Page 56. <hi>It is more for the ſake of the truly Faithful, than for themſelves, that the Hypocrites have their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Priviledges in the Church; God makes uſe of their Gifts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion for his Elect, to many great Services of the Church.</hi> To which I anſwer, That this Language betrays thee further to be of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not of <hi>Zion;</hi> What <hi>R. B.</hi> with all his ſeeming Zeal for Reformation in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s days, become now a Pleader for Hypocrites, and their great Service in the Church! But this is but like his Doctrine of his Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miniſters which he pleads for, Page 114 of his Book; ſo <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Hypocrites, and Graceleſs Brethren, with their Gifts, (or rather Thefts void of Grace) have been ſo far from being ſerviceable to the Elect True Church, that they have done it (and ever did) all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that ever they can by their wicked Doctrines, Ungodly Lives, and heaps of Lyes and falſe Accuſations, and cruel Perſecutions; inſomuch that the Growth of the Heavenly Seed, the Lillies of God, the true Heirs of the Kingdom, hath been, and is, as a Lilly among Thorns: But Chriſt and <hi>R. B.</hi> are directly contrary in their Judgment one to the other; for Chriſt would not ſuffer the Devil in the Man to preach him, but commanded him to come out, and hold his peace, becauſe Chriſt never had need of Devils, or wicked Men, or Hypocrites, to preach him; but ſaith to ſuch, <hi>What haſt thou to do, to take my Laws and Covenant in thy Mouth, and hateſt to be reformed,</hi> Pſal. 50.16, &amp;c. and ſo far are Graceleſs Prieſts and Hypocrites from being ſerviceable in this matter to his Church, that he ſaith, <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and they follow me;</hi> but the Graceleſs Miniſter and Hypocrite, who is a Stranger to me, they will not hear, for ſuch come but to rob and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, read <hi>John</hi> 10. and ſee if ever <hi>R. B.</hi> underſtood Scripture, who talks ſo contrary to it: As did thoſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, whom Chriſt cried out ſo many times Wo againſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>Who would neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer others.</hi> And thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who ſowed Pillows under Mens Elbows, making glad the Hearts of the wicked Hirelings, by perſwading People that they muſt not diſown them from being Miniſters, though they be totally void of obeying Saving Grace; and that Hypocrites have a Station in the Church, for great Services with their pretended Gifts to the Elect; and by pleading for Games, and Faſhions of Apparel; yea, and the Opinions in Religion of bad People, yea to ſuch a meaſure, that he is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>That many an Error is taken up, by going too far from other Mens
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97179:149"/>Faults;</hi> as is to be ſeen in Page 224 of his Book, with many ſuch like Heatheniſh Sayings up and down his Book; a few whereof I only touch here and there, that by thoſe the Reader may ſee the nature of that wretched Spirit, that hath long lurked in him, under a Cloak of Zeal for Reformation, when the World pretended to ſuch things; but now that the World is for a manifeſt Eſtabliſhing of their old dark Stuff, he turns about, and is all for them as it were, and againſt Zeal, againſt Reformation, Separation, Immediate Revelation, or any thing that may manifeſt People to have a care of their Souls: But Oh the Miſery, the Miſery, the unſpeakable Miſery of ſuch as are not yet redeemed from under the Slavery and Egyptian Bondage of ſuch Men: But the Lord will break the Rod of the Oppreſſor, as in times of old, as in the days of <hi>Midian</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where both <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Lord's Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his calling <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were made manifeſt, and their Folly by all clearly ſeen, as this <hi>R. B</hi>'s is by every open Eye: Praiſed be the Lord for his Infinite Love in all things.</p>
                     <p>But the Hearts of the Righteous, whom God delights to comfort, he doth all he can to make Sad, by perſwading the dark cruel World, that the cauſe of all the Miſeries of the late years, yea, and at preſent in theſe <hi>Iſlands,</hi> is much (what if not moſtly) occaſioned by thoſe, who in tenderneſs of Conſcience to God, could not, nor cannot joyn with, nor uphold the Popiſh Cuſtoms, and Impoſition in Matters relating to Religion, and the Soul, which is more pretious to them that know it, than all the World: And in the Truth we may ſay, that if we ſhould come amongſt the Steeple-houſe Worſhippers, or any other Company, who are only ſeparated from them in Form, and not in Life and Power, and their exerciſe, not in the Gift, and Heavenly Holy Worſhip and Service to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our God, we ſhould even Sacrifice the Abomination of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> before their Eyes; and now would you not Stone us, or Impriſon us, or otherwiſe evilly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>treat us, even as you do, and ever have done? Yea, yea, and as they dealt with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for ſaying (Chap. 66.3.) <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a Man; he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dog's Neck,</hi> &amp;c. and Chap. 1.11, &amp;c. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord, I am full of them; and who hath required it at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations,</hi> &amp;c. For which it is ſaid they ſlew him; ſo they would deal with us. And what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have the dear Servants of God in <hi>New-England</hi> met withal, not long ſince, for the like witneſs againſt thoſe Hypocrites, but Death and cruel Whippings, and Baniſhment; and in old <hi>England</hi> lately, but moſt Savage and Cruel Uſage? And would this <hi>R. B.</hi> yet have us, yea, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97179:149"/>thoſe he counts his Brethren, and of his Flock, who have any Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, to communicate with ſuch whoſe Hands are full of Blood? If he were as the Mouth of God, he would put a difference between the Clean and Unclean: But he being of another Spirit, is for leading Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> not for bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Promiſed Land; which Work and Endeavour is rejected of God, and of all that know God, who are eſcaped out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> Spiritual, where our Lord was Crucified: And to us the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Let them return to you (ye Saved People) but return not you to them; For their Paſtors are become brutiſh, and have not ſought the Lord; therefore they ſhall not proſper, and all their Flocks ſhall be ſcattered, Jer.</hi> 10.21. He that hath Ears let him hear, and he that readeth let him underſtand, for the time is at hand, for the Lord is ariſen to plead with all the Falſe Worſhippers upon Earth, and with him is no reſpect of Perſons. And now is the Lord God of ever bleſſed Power and love appeared in the Earth, after the long Night of Apoſtacy, to reſtore all things; and now are the Virgins called upon, through the whole World, to trim their Lamps; for behold the Bridegroom is come and coming, and now the fooliſh Virgins, who have been long ſleeping and ſlumbering, in a dead Profeſſion of Chriſt and the Scriptures, are found wanting in their Faith, Holineſs, Love, and all other Chriſtian Virtues, and ſo in their Unholineſs ſhut out; yea, and though they run to the Hirelings, that ſet all things to Sale, to Buy, yet ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, the Door is ſhut; for whilſt the Lord ſtood waiting upon them, with his pure free and full Grace and Spirit, they would have none of it; but rather choſed to go their own ways of Carnal Endeavours, and Man-commanded Religion, and ſo like the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, going about to Eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: But the wiſe Virgns, who are of an honeſt Heart, to fear God, and wait for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to appear in their Spirits, to ſet up his heavenly and everlaſting Kingdom in them, they receive daily of his Fullneſs, which filleth all in all, where the true Oyl of the Kingdom is found in their Holy Lamps, to the Praiſe of the Glory of the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love, and free Grace of the Almighty Father. So be it.</p>
                     <p>Again, to that part of this <hi>R. B</hi>'s former Anſwer, where he ſaith, <hi>That in all Ages, God giveth to ſome few Men more excellent Natural Parts than others, and he engageth ſome in deeper and more laborious Studies, and he bleſſeth ſome Mens Studies more than other; and therefore there are ſtill ſome few, who know more than the reſt of the Country, or Mankind; and it were well for the reſt if they knew theſe, and would learn of them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Query.</hi> But how may one know theſe hard and laborious Studiers, as he calls them?</p>
                     <p>Oh, ſaith this <hi>R. B. They are ſuch as give proof of their Knowledge they pretend to; and they are ſuch as imploy their Knowledge to the preſerving of the Peace and Concord of Believers; and do not proudly make a ſtir with it, to ſet up their own Names; though thereby they ſet the World on fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, It is ſtill more and more manifeſt, that this <hi>R. B.</hi> lays the weight and ſtreſs upon Natural Parts, and hard Studies; as though the Kingdom of God were not at all come, nor the Promiſe of God (concerning the Free Gifts, and plentiful pouring forth of the Spirit) yet fulfilled; and ſo a neceſſity of learning at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and earthly Doctors ſtill: But now that the Spirit of Truth, according to God's bleſſed Promiſe, is come, and witneſſed amongſt us that believe, praiſed be God, we cannot go to ſuch as this <hi>R. B.</hi> with all their Natural Parts, and hard Studies; for the Spirit of Truth leads us, and all that obey it, into all Truth; but this <hi>R. B.</hi> and ſuch as he leads, are in an Error, as is manifeſt; for they are of thoſe that lead about a Company of poor Souls, ſilly as Women laden with divers Sins and Luſts, ever learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, which ſets free from Sin; for that (and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe) is the Truth, which ſets free from Sin; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If ye know the Truth, the Truth ſhall ſet you free indeed.</hi> But this <hi>R. B.</hi> and all ſuch, teach it for Doctrine, <hi>That they are ſo far from being free from Sin, that their very Prayers, and beſt Performances, are not free from Sin, but Sin is in them all.</hi> Oh Sad, that ever they ſhould dare to pretend to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, who preach ſuch a Doctrine as make nothing perfect, but leaves them in Sin all their Lives long: And no wonder that they and their Doctrine ſhould be void of all good Fruit; for ſaith God, <hi>They have run, and I have not ſent them; therefore they ſhall not profit the People at all.</hi> And yet they would gladly have People know them, and learn of them, though they can do them no good at all; and this is that ſorry and bad Proof, that the Hirelings make of their great Knowledge they pretend unto, which they have gotten with their Natural Parts, and hard Studies: And ſo thy own words ſhall witneſs againſt thee, Oh <hi>R. B.</hi> and thy Brethren, who have given no good Proof of your Knowledge to this day; nor have thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Peace and Concord amongſt Believers, but done what you can to break it; for that Doctrine that makes not Men free from Sin, leaves all the Seeds of Diſcord and Diſſention ſtill in Peoples Minds; for as Sin ſeparated Man from God at firſt, ſo doth it to this day keep them, and ſo keeps them from Love, for God is Love; and none live or dwell in Love, but ſuch as live and dwell in God: But ſuch as live in Sin,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97179:150"/>and never Pray without it, are out of God, as the Apoſtle ſaid of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Unbelief, <hi>They were without God in the World.</hi> It is not any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conformity, that will or can make them to be at Peace with, or love one another; for if it were poſſible to bring <hi>Papiſt, Atheiſt,</hi> and Carnal <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Profeſſors of all ſorts, into one Form of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip, as for Time, Place, Words, or the like: Yet there would be neither Love, Peace, nor Concord amongſt them, for want of Unity with God and his good Spirit, the only true Ground and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all true Love, Peace, and Concord. And ſo, Oh <hi>R. B.</hi> we have known thee this many Years to be a great Enemy, and therefore we may not learn of thee, nor any ſuch, but of Chriſt do we learn, ever praiſed be his Name, who teaches his People to profit; and ſo it's only the poor deluded Multitude that knows thee not, who learn of thee, and ſuck in ſuch poyſoned Doctrine, as makes them moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the pure Word of Life, and Doctrine of Salvation; ſo that <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> who make little or no Profeſſion, enter into the Kingdom of God before you.</p>
                     <p>And as for making a ſtir with thy Knowledge, and ſtriving to ſet up thy own Name thereby, though thou ſet the whole World on fire by it; Who more Notorious than thy ſelf in this <hi>R.B?</hi> as witneſs all thy lying frothy Words, Books, and Pamphlets, which thou haſt ſpoken and written, againſt the appearance of Chriſt and his Truth, in theſe late years; but thy Studies and ſuch Works God hath curſed; for no Child of Light will ever buy any of thy Merchandize, nor the deceitful Wares of any other Merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for evermore Bleſſed be God for his unſpeakable Gift, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the end of theſe words, of ſetting the World on fire, ſet down here by this <hi>R. B.</hi> is eaſily ſeen to be this, to wit, To perſwade Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that thoſe who are Zealous for God in theſe days, in publiſhing his everlaſting Goſpel upon the Earth, in a croſs to the World, are ſuch as ſet up themſelves, and would ſet the World on fire: And ſo he is manifeſt to be one of the old evil Generation of Prieſts, who accuſed Chriſt for a mover of Sedition, and <hi>Paul</hi> for a peſtilent Fellow: Oh, it was that good ſtirring Spirit of the Lord Jeſus in himſelf, and his Followers, which did ſo trouble the World, the combuſtible World in all Ages, that made, and doth make, the Hireling Prieſts, and their deluded Followers, ſo rage and cry out; but as for ſetting the World on fire, in a good ſence, Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, That he came to ſet Fire in the Earth: But for ſetting the World on fire, in <hi>R. B</hi>'s ſence, that is ſowing Diſcord and Diſſention amongſt People; this is the Work, and ever was the Work of the Hireling Prieſts, who loved to be called of Men Maſters, as this <hi>R. B.</hi> is, witneſs not only our own Age, but

What Ignorance in our Minds! So wanting are we even in the loweſt Grace Humility, that we have ſcarce enough to make us take patiently, as now we are giving out upon others; So Selfiſh, as Diſhonoureth our Profeſſion, with the Brand of Contradictedneſs and Partiality; ſo weak, that our Duties are lyable to greater Cenſures than we can bear; and our inward Graces weaker than our outward Duties</hi> [This muſt needs be ſo in the Duties of the Graceleſs Miniſter thou pleads for] <hi>of ſuch ungoverned Thoughts, that Confuſion and Tumult, inſtead of Order and Fruitful Improvement, are the daily Temper and Imployment of our Imaginations</hi> [This muſt needs be ſo in you that Live in ſuch Oppoſition to the Life of God manifeſt in his Children at this Day] <hi>So Paſſionate, Impatient and Corrupt, that we are a trouble to our ſelves and others,</hi> [This muſt needs proceed from ſuch a corrupt Fountain] <hi>and a Diſhonour to the Goſpel</hi> [it is ſo] <hi>and a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Converſion of thoſe whom our holy Exemplary Lives ſhould win to God: So ſtrange to Heaven, as if we had never well believed it</hi> [that is ſo, and therefore the Sheep of Chriſt deny your Voice, you who are ſuch Strangers to him] <hi>And to ſay all in one, ſo empty of Love to our dear Redeemer, and to the God of Love, that our Hearts lye vacant to entertain the Love of Worldly Vanities</hi> [ye Hypocrites, what have you to do to name Chriſt, who are thus Unbelieving and Unredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] <hi>and to fly back from the ſerious Thoughts of God, which ſhould be our daily Work and Pleaſure, and fly from the Face of Death, as if we ſhould be the worſt, when neareſt to our God.</hi> Oh Hypocrites! how can you for ſhame call God yours, when you are thus beyond meaſure bad, when Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that ſaith, he knows God, and keeps not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a Lyer, and the Truth is not in him,</hi> ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97179:152"/>under ſuch woful Sins and Condemnation, as is here ſpoken of: But ſurely if you did believe, and feel inwardly that it were ſo bad with you, as here in Words is ſignified, you could not go away ſo lightly with your Burdens, as you ſeem to do, but it would ſtop your Mouths, and cauſe all your Pride and Glory to ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>For conſider but the firſt thing, that this <hi>R.

So that it may eaſily be known who ſent this <hi>R. B.</hi> who hath profited you nothing at all: <hi>For they have run, and I have not ſent them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Therefore they cannot profit the People at all,</hi> Jer. 23. And that this <hi>R. B.</hi> might make it fully appear under whoſe Banner he Fights, and for whoſe Kingdom he Pleads, leſt the reſt of his Book ſhould leave it doubtful: He is now come forth in his proper ſhape of an Enemy of God, and good Men, that in any meaſure are looking Heaven-ward, being burdened with the Fellowſhip of the Wicked, and inſtead of helping the Lord's little Ones, againſt the great Power of the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the Perſecutors, he hath hammered forth Weapons for the Wicked Perſecutors, and againſt the tender-hearted Ones of God, who are travelling to the Holy Land, with <hi>Egypt</hi> left behind; as in that 55 Direction, ſo called, and Page 254. of his ſaid Book appears, where he hath theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Little do many real Separates, who cry out againſt the Spirit of Perſecution, ſuſpect that the ſame Spirit is in them; whence is Perſecution, but from thinking ill of others, and abhorring them, or not loving them?

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97179:153"/>or Wicked Separation; yet, Reader, thou muſt know, he intends as well the truly Tender-hearted People of <hi>England,</hi> who in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and according to his Holy Commandment are come out, and ſeparated from the Fellowſhip of the Wicked in theſe Days, and ſo cannot take part in the Offerings of the Dead as well as others; and at theſe, in a ſpecial manner, he ſtrikes, after his accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, through the ſides of others; for his main Envy is againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Members of Chriſt: And ſo though thoſe that ſeparate without cauſe, may have the like mind to thoſe that ſeparate from being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent only in Form, but not in Heart from them; yet ſuch as are ſeparated by the Power of God (as <hi>Paul</hi> was, whom God ſeparated from his Mothers Womb, calling him by his Grace) have not; for theſe ſtand out of their own thoughts, and are in the Will, and Work, and Worſhip of God, whoſe Worſhip is in Spirit and Truth: But to proceed, <hi>R.

                     <p>
                        <hi>You will ſay, that though you think them not to be true Chriſtians, yet you love them as Men, and wiſh their good, and ſo will thoſe ſay by you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom you call your Perſecutors; though they think you to be Proud and Humerous, and Diſobedient, yet they ſay, they love you as Men; and do but correct you, to cure your Self willedneſs and Humour, and to do you good, and to preſerve the publick Peace: They think you to be bad, and therefore Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon you: You think them to be bad, and therefore avoid Communion with them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I cannot but by the way ſpeak a word; Who is there that ſees not the very Spirit of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers acting in this very thing, to the hardening of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart, leſt he ſhould let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? But this <hi>R.

And when it is objected, that of all Men living, no Man think that a Perſecutor is godly, and fit for Church-Communion, he doth not like a Chriſtian confeſs to the Truth thereof, but after his accuſtomed manner, Heathen-like, he invents his ſorry ſhifts to avoid the force of the Truth, by ſaying, <hi>Did all the Miniſters and Common People perſecute you?</hi> And then asking a Queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doings of the Souldiers under <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the like, which are meer ſhifts; <hi>For what is the doings of any Men, to make void the Truth by it?

                     <hi>Ye take the Examples of Religious Men, to be one of your moſt Perilous Temptations; and therefore labour to diſcover, eſpecially what are the Sins of Profeſſors, in the Age that you live in, that you may eſpecially watch and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your Souls againſt them:</hi> [And adds] <hi>That ſometimes the ſtricteſt Sort run in a Gang after one Opinion, and ſometimes after another.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I Appeal to that of God in all that fear his Name, and are alive to Truth, whether this do not wholly tend to the hardening of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart, againſt the People of God in theſe Days, who are in the Truth it ſelf, and not in Opinions, as the Hypocrites are? For though ſuch as are begotten into Forms of Religion (without the Truth) by the Hirelings, do never ceaſe from erring, yet the truly Religious, who are begotten to God by Chriſt, walk in the Way undefiled, which the Fools, who are upright in Heart cannot err in.</p>
                  <p>But this his telling of running in a Gang, is a filthy and reproachful Speech, wholly of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and the Lord will judge thee, O Enemy! for thy work <hi>R.

                  <p>And to conclude, If any would ſee this Harlot in its fine Dreſs, and the Crooked Serpent in its glittering Colour on the Head which muſt be bruiſed, and yet with his Sting in his Tail, which is full of Venom, let them conſider that 44th Direction, which runs thus,</p>

B!</hi> to talk of this, who art one with the Corrupt, pleading for Conformity, even with the Perſecutors of Godlineſs it ſelf? Yea, ſeeking to make ſuch, as good and excuſeable before the Lord in their Perſecutions of the Godly, as the Godly themſelves are, who in Obedience to God do ſeparate from them: What! Is Praying to God with ſin in your Hearts, the higheſt Degree of your Godlineſs? Oh Hypocrites! Yea, it is: And is your Conforming to the Worſhip-Actions of the Perſecutors, who take God's Name in vain, when ever they mention it in that State, no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? And not only ſo, but your Oneneſs with the Times in many of their Corrupt Cuſtoms of daily Converſation, as every Eye ſees, no Corruptions? But above all, Corruption is gone forth over all the Land, even from the Teachers, ſuch as this <hi>R. B.</hi> is, who in words can tell others of forſaking it; for what greater Corruption, than for the Prieſts to love to be called of Men <hi>Maſters, and to Preach for Hire, and Divine for Money, and to cry, Peace, Peace to the Wicked; eſpecially ſuch as put into their Mouths: But if any put not into their Mouths, then they prepare War againſt them,</hi> as both in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, and ſince, they have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97179:156"/>done, to the impoveriſhing and ſpoiling them that fear God of their Goods, and impriſoning ſeveral to Death upon the ſame account: What would Chriſt, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.) and the Prophets, <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> and the reſt, have cried ſo vehemently againſt ſuch things, if they had not been grievous Corruptions of the Times? See <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.30, 31. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5, &amp;c. And ſo when the Prieſts are Proud, and Covetous, and Cruel; what can their Followers be, but like them? It is not the Prieſts telling People, they muſt deſire after Holineſs, and forſake the Corruptions of the Times, that will do any good, ſo long as the Teachers themſelves live in Unholineſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſmite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs; for doth not that in the Conſcience ſay to ſuch? Thou that teacheſt another; why doeſt not thou teach thy ſelf: <hi>But they have run, and God hath not ſent them, therefore</hi> (they are ſuch Briars, and Thiſtles, and) <hi>cannot profit the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all, Jer.</hi> 23. And they ſay to every one that walks after the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their evil Hearts, ye ſhall have Peace: But for theſe things, the Lord hath, and yet will ſeverely judge them, Head and Tail, Root and Branch, in his great Day.</p>
                  <p>And now to that which he ſaith to his Diſciples; <hi>Be not odd and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular from ordinary</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in lawful things, if it be to go in a meaner Garb than others, or not to put off the Hat, or to go bare-foot, or in a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Habit, this gratifieth Pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I may ſay, Wo be to them that call Evil Good, and Good Evil, that account keeping on the Hat in ſimplicity of Heart to God, as we do our other Garments, without Contempt to any; I ſay, that account and call this Evil, and yet account putting off the Hat, in Honour to Proud Fleſh, Good; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath reſpect to Perſons committeth Sin, and is convinced of the Law as a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, Jam.</hi> 2.9. But <hi>R.B.</hi> in this his pleading for the Hat, ſaith [it is lawful] but to keep Chriſt's Commands, in having reſpect to Chriſt, and not to the Perſons of Men [oddneſs and ſingularity] though this Man, and his Fellows, condemn us for this, yet Chriſt juſtifies us, and ſo we have Peace with God: And for going in a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Garb than others; whoſoever he intends by this, we know that he, and all ſuch Proud Maſterly Teachers, are far enough from this, for they are quite out in the other Extream; for if you will find Pride and Prodigality, who more Notorious in the Land than the Prieſts and their Families, who live in Pride, Idleneſs, Fulneſs of Bread, and the poor People ſee it, though they are forced to labour and drudge for them, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt: And ſo they ſpend their Money, for that which is not Bread, and their Labours, for that which ſatisfies not their Souls,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Old complain'd; and that which is moſt ſad, they muſt do it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97179:157"/>by force; for if the People do ſee them to be totally void of Grace in their Lives, yet according to <hi>R. B</hi>'s Doctrine, they muſt not take them for no Miniſters, however they muſt be at coſt with them, to maintain them in their Pride and Idleneſs, or elſe look for a Priſon, or ſpoiling of their Goods, or the like; but the Lord hath ſhaken his Hand at ſuch diſhoneſt Gain. But as for a diſtinguiſhing Habit, which this <hi>R. B.</hi> Charges upon the <hi>Friars;</hi> how is it that he could not ſee himſelf, and his Brethren, in their diſtinguiſhing Habits of Black Gowns, Black Cloths, Tippets, Hoods, Surplices, and the like? Oh! theſe Unjuſt Men, who are all Eye abroad, and none at home; but this was ever the Nature of ſuch as were out of Chriſt's Doctrine. Alſo whereas this <hi>R. B.</hi> by theſe words, [That all may ſee and ſay, this is a ſingular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Religion] doth endeavour to make People believe, that, our not putting off our Hats, (which we do meerly in Obedience to God, who commands us not to honour proud Fleſh) is done for a ſelfiſh End, and in our own Wills, to get a Name, is ſuch a piece of Haughtineſs and Fooliſhneſs in him, that nothing but meer Envy could have taught him ſuch a piece of Unreaſonableneſs; for who is there that ſees not the contrary Effect to come of our not putting off our Hat, to what <hi>R. B.</hi> here ſets down? For it is ſo far from getting us a Name of being Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious amongſt Men, that they do as it were with one Mouth cry out againſt us, unmannerly Fellows, and the like, for it: And truly, but that the pure Fear of God ſtrengthens us, it were impoſſible for us to bear the Reproaches, Finings, and Beatings, and daily Croſs that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this very ſame thing; ſo that to croſs proud Fleſh in this one thing, expoſes the poor Creature to great Trials in theſe degenerate Days, even amongſt them that profeſs Chriſt, (who made himſelf of no Reputation in this World) from whom one might expect better uſage, for ſo harmleſs a thing: But as Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and Diſciples, found no better uſage amongſt the profeſſing <hi>Jews</hi> of thoſe Days, for doing the Will of God: So we are even made content to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all things for the Truth's ſake from our own Country-men and Profeſſors in theſe Days, even from all who profeſs the Letter, and want the Life and Vertue of what they do profeſs: And praiſed be God for Ever, who through his Grace gives our Souls the Victory; but as for this <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Followers, who are ſo full of that earthly faln Wiſdom, which receives Honour of Men, and judges of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh; I ſay, for them to ſeek God's Honour, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in ſuch low contemptible things, as this is, is at preſent far from them; but to put off the Hat in Honour to proud Fleſh, <hi>and to love g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97179:157"/>Applauſe of the World, though Chriſt forbid it never ſo much, I ſay, theſe things they like better, the more is the pity; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and ſo it appears who are in the Selfiſhneſs, Pride and Hypocriſie, and who are not; and ſo is the Scripture fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>In that Day it ſhall be ſeen, who are they that fear God, and who not;</hi> Glory to God for his unſpeakable Gift, and not unto us, but to thy Name be the Praiſe, O Lord.</p>
                  <p>What would this <hi>R. B.</hi> (if he had been in thoſe Days) have ſaid of Chriſt, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>That he taught the Way of God truly, and regarded not the Perſons of Men,</hi> (then ſurely he put not off a Hat in Honour to proud Fleſh, as ye do) I ſay, would not this Man have called him ſome odd Conceited, Singular, Proud Fellow, like as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of thoſe Days <hi>(who received Honour one of another)</hi> did? No queſtion but he would; for if he do thus to us his Servants, what would he have done to him our Lord and Maſter? But happy are all they in this Day, who chuſe rather to ſuffer the Affliction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with Chriſt and his People, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a Seaſon. So be it.</p>
                  <p>Alſo becauſe this <hi>R. B.</hi> in Page 27. of his <hi>Preface</hi> ſaith, <hi>That People are far more averſe (that is, contrary or againſt) to Communion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the Pariſh Churches, than the Conforming Miniſters are;</hi> and yet he ſeems in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Bryan</hi>'s Book, to be unwilling that People ſhould think he hath Conformed, though he hath pleaded for it, and againſt Separating from the Pariſh Aſſemblies and Worſhips, as now manag'd: And alſo ſeeing that <hi>Bryan,</hi> as he ſaith, is, or was ſilenced for Nonconformity himſelf, I deſire all that reads theſe Lines, to take notice of what a ſtrange, uneven and unrighteous Spirit theſe Men are of, in their creeping, and twiſting, and twining to and fro; yet the Eye of the Lord, and his Bleſſed Spirit in his Children this Day doth eaſily ſpy them out: Sometimes they are all for Conformity, and againſt Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by any means, and plead the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>-Peoples Cauſe with all their might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were; and yet preſently they are all on a fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any that ſhall think they are Conformiſts: Nay, ſays <hi>R. B. How can any judge him to be a Conformiſt, who is ſilenced for Nonconformity?</hi> But if this Man, (ſometime a Head to thoſe called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at and about <hi>Kidderminſter</hi>) and <hi>Bryan</hi> of the ſame Nature, ſometimes a Teacher at <hi>Coventry,</hi> be not Conformed, or be not yet Conformiſts, as well as others of their Brethren, who have long ſince ſwallowed down, the Old <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Service, as they called it, which they rejected in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, becauſe it hindred them then from devouring the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Labours; and ſeeing they plead ſo ſhameleſly for it now; and alſo

But I deſire that all People, who fear the Lord, would take heed of ſuch dangerous Hereſies; for the Scriptures of Truth do not allow of Falſhood in any Sence at all; for it's abſolutely falſe in the ſight of God, and to all good Men, that Infants, by any ſuch outward Sprinkling or doing (as they call Baptiſm) are made the Children of God, Members of Chriſt, Heirs of his Kingdom; ſeeing the Scripture now here commands any ſuch thing, but ſaith, <hi>That except People be born from above, they cannot ſee the Kingdom of God:</hi> But the Day is dawned, that makes all things manifeſt, Praiſes to God: And therefore People conſider what a Wretchedneſs thoſe are under, who follow ſuch blind Guides, as turn and change with every Time, and can be any thing or nothing in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo that they can but keep up their Name amongſt Men. What, was was the <hi>Common-Prayers,</hi> and ſuch things, ſo odious a thing in the Eyes of theſe Prieſts in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Time? And is it now, yea the worſt part of it, become ſuch an Idol in their Eyes, as that thoſe that dwell in God, muſt be condemned of deep Prejudice for not Conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it? What, will not that Spirit that climbs over the Door, and never was ſent of God to preach the Goſpel, ſay, or unſay, ſo as it can
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97179:159"/>but pleaſe the preſent Times? But Oh thou Blaſphemous <hi>Bryan,</hi> the Accuſer of the Brethren; Can thoſe that dwell with God, deny to conform to that Worſhip or Service which is of God? And therefore it is ſafely and truly concluded, that the <hi>Service</hi> thou pleads for, is not of God, becauſe for Conſcience to God, with whom they dwell, they cannot conform to it: But Oh how the <hi>Serpent</hi> creeps upon his Belly to do miſchief, by ſeeking to perſwade the Conſciencious People, <hi>That by their not joyning with the Pariſh-Worſhips and Aſſemblies, they open their Mouths wide, to caſt a Scandal upon their Perſons, as Prophane, and upon the ſtrict Profeſſion of walking preciſely according to the written Word, which they think</hi> (ſays this <hi>Bryan,</hi> in that P. 292. of his Book) <hi>gives you no warrant for your Separation,</hi> &amp;c.

And ſo we are not yet to examine, whether our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be ſinful, or nay; for that is done, and we do know it to be good, according to the good Word from the beginning, moſt certainly. And ſo the Offence which the Pariſh-worſhippers take, is Offence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Canſe on our parts given; and ſo it is no other, than the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers took in all Generations, againſt them that feared God; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were offended at Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yea, and all Chriſtians in thoſe days, becauſe they could not worſhip with their Neighbours in their Superſtitions, as this <hi>Bryan</hi> would have us; and not only ſo, but they killed Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and grievouſly perſecuted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for their Separation then, as they do us at this day; and ſo the Reproach of Chriſt, is to us great Riches, and the Perſecutors God will examine and judge: And as <hi>Moſes</hi> did chuſe rather to ſuffer Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the People of God, than to enjoy <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Glory for a Seaſon, ſo B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97179:159"/>endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the Shame; and ſo through all the Tryals and Perſecutions of this World, enter into God's Glory, where none can come to make afraid.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any, who through Prejudice (as this <hi>Bryan</hi> ſpeaks) and not by the Spirit of the Lord, are ſeparated from the Pariſh-Worſhip; it is neceſſary for ſuch to ſee to themſelves, and conſider, leſt their Return be as Shameful, as their Separation was Sinful, (like this <hi>Bryan</hi> and <hi>R. B</hi>) who, it ſeems, all this while, have been no real and true Separatiſts to God; but have been only in the Self ſeparation according to the Will and Force of Times: For though the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Followers of ſuch Men, be at preſent more averſe from joyning with the Superſtitions of the Times, than your Hearers are (as <hi>R. B.</hi> ſays) yet if you grow not out of their rotten Root, into the Root Chriſt Jeſus, you will be weary and faint in your Way before the end: But let all know, that theſe Self-ſeparatiſts, who have not their Birth of God, are not real Dwellers with God; though this <hi>Bryan,</hi> it's like, had an Eye eſpecially to ſuch in his words, and to whom, it's like, in a ſpecial manner he applies his fawning flattering Words and Deſires: But what's the Reaſon, may we ſay again, that theſe Non-conforming Miniſters, by <hi>R. B</hi>'s report, are not ſo much againſt the Pariſh Way of Worſhip, as now managed, as their Hearers are, ſave only their groſs Hypocriſie, and ſelf-ſeeking Nature, and double Mind, as was hinted before? For they have carried the People in hand, that they would ſuffer; yea, what would they not ſuffer, rather than Conform: And now behold how this Teacher of Teachers <hi>(R. B.)</hi> hath bewrayed their Nakedneſs: O People, People, who have been long deceived by ſuch double-minded ones (who are unſtable in all their Ways) that you would turn your Minds from them, to the true Light of Jeſus Chriſt in your Conſcience, that with it you might firſt ſee your ſelves, and ſo growing up in that true Light, you might come to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, who never fell, nor never changeth, to be your Teacher and Miniſter; and ſo come from off the Barren Mountains, whether theſe, and the like, deceitful Men (<hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>Bryan</hi>) have led you, and left you; for now is the Lord making unto all People a Feaſt of Fat things, of Wine on the Lees well refined, ever praiſed be his Name for it: And now, if after all the Light that the Lord hath ſet up in this day, you will not be warned to come into the Liberty of the Sons of God, and ſo accept of God's Freedom in his Son freely tendered you; what remains? But if you be faſtned more in the Pit of Darkneſs with all Unbelievers, it is juſt.</p>
                  <p>But whereas this <hi>R. B.</hi> tells of his Brother <hi>Bryan</hi>'s ſilencing formerly for not Conforming, it had been well for him that he had been ſilent
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97179:160"/>ſtill, rather than have opened his Mouth thus to the diſhonour of God, and ſtrengthening Deceit in the Deceitful, and ſo to the Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his own Face; and all his raking up ſomething here and there, as he could get hold of it in his dark Imaginations, for Pariſh-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it is ſo nothing to the purpoſe, and ſo well ſeen to be ſo, by all that are not wilfully blind, that it ſerves only to diſcover his own Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and rotten in ſide, as not only by what hath been already ſaid, but by what alſo now follows doth further appear, as in Page 295 is ſet down, where he faith,</p>

                     <hi>It is no ſufficient Warrant to ſeparate from a Church, becauſe it is guilty of ſuch Sins and Corruptions as deſerves God ſhould forſake, and for which he hath threatned in his Word, that he will forſake it.</hi> (Here by the way take notice, that this <hi>Bryan</hi> here conſidered not, that he fully makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Hypocriſie of his Brother <hi>R.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which ſtrange Doctrine of this <hi>Bryan,</hi> to which <hi>R. B.</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>Amen;</hi> I ſay, in the firſt place, it is abſolute Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Name and Nature of God, either to ſay, or imagine, that God dwells with ſuch a People as are guilty of ſuch Sins and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, as this <hi>Bryan</hi> here ſpeaks of; and how far unlike this <hi>Bryan</hi>'s Spirit is, to the Spirit of the Prophets, who ſaid, <hi>God is of purer Eyes, than to behold Iniquity; and your Sins have ſeparated betwixt you and your God:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>That thoſe that would have God to dwell in them</hi> (and it's certain God dwells with none, but as he dwells in them) <hi>they muſt be ſeparated, and touch no unclean thing,</hi> 2 Cor 6.16, 17, 18. And doth the Lord command us to come out from amongſt the Unclean? And will he himſelf, the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> dwell with the Unclean, yea, with ſuch as are guilty of ſuch Sins and Corruptions, as deſerve that God ſhould forſake them for them; yea, for which God hath threatned in his Word, that he will forſake them? And certainly there can be no Way, nor Means, to ſtay or hinder the Execution of God's Judgments threatned and deſerved, but by forſaking thoſe Sins and Corruptions which ſuch People are guilty of, which the People of <hi>England</hi> (that this <hi>Bryan</hi>) would have us, and others, to joyn with, are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97179:160"/>far from; for, O <hi>England, England,</hi> thou and thy Pariſhes are polluted that will not come to Chriſt, that they might have Life; but perſecutes them (with unreaſonableneſs, and cruel Uſages) that the Lord hath raiſed up, to forewarn thee of his Judgments: And ſo thy Houſe being deſtitute of God's Fear and Goodneſs, we are not more Holy than God, nor hate Corruption more than he, in our ſeparating from thee, as this wicked Man <hi>Bryan</hi> would have thee falſly believe; but in our ſeparating from thee, we do the Lord's Command, and follow his bleſſed Example; and ſo we cannot receive that for God's Houſe, which he dwells not in: And ſo thou art a Falſe Witneſs, O <hi>Bryan,</hi> and a Blaſphemer of God and his Tabernacle; for the Temple and Tebernacle of God is Holy; which Temple are his Holy Members and Body the True Church; not <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Falſe, Sinful and Corrupted Church, which <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>Bryan</hi> pleads for: And <hi>if any defile the Temple of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>him will God</hi> (not call his Houſe, and Dwelling-place, but) <hi>deſtroy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.17.</p>
                  <p>Again, How ſhall this groſs Contradiction, which this twiſting twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Serpent</hi> makes, be ſalved? For this <hi>Bryan</hi> one while ſays, It's to be Holier than God, to ſeparate from ſuch a ſinful corrupt Sort, as deſerves God's Judgments: And yet with the ſame Moutli ſaith, We may not Communicate with them, by conſenting to any Corruptions that are, or ſhall be detected, or proved to be in ſuch a People. What, joyn with a manifeſt Corrupted Body, whoſe very Prayers (by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) are not without Sin, and not ſo much as conſent to any of their Corruptions? What a Joyning is this, when it muſt not be a Joyning; no, not ſo much as in the Conſent: What groſs dark Contradiction is here (and now to bring this a little home to the buſineſs of <hi>England</hi>) a Doctor (ſo called) and Pleader for Conformity, and Communion with the Pariſh worſhippers of <hi>England,</hi> which are detected, and manifeſtly proved; yea, and not only by their words, but by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion alſo, to be miſerable Offenders againſt God; yea, ſo guilty, and full of Sins and Corruptions, from the Crown of the Head, to the Soles of their Feet, as that they have no Health nor Soundneſs at all in them, would have us conform to them; and yet he ſaith, We may not communicate with them, by conſenting to any of their proved Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Then I ſay, If we may not have Fellowſhip with them in their Corruptions, no, not ſo much as by conſent; then we muſt not have Fellowſhip with them at all, for they and their Corruptions are one; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, for his Works ye will do.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Bryan,</hi> Chriſt was a Member of this Church (as he calls it) of thoſe wicked <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe he was Circumciſed, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Temple, and eat the Paſſover; than which Saying of this <hi>Bryan,</hi> nothing can be more Falſe; for what, though Chriſt was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97179:161"/>and went ſometimes into the Temple, and eat the Paſſover, which had been Ordinances of God for their time, and were Shadows of good Things to come; What is that to prove Chriſt a Member of that Body, whoſe Houſe was left unto them deſolate, and who were headed by the Devil, which at length put them on to murder him? O fad, that ever People in their love of the World ſhould be ſo blind! But what is Chriſt's conforming to the Shadows of the <hi>Law,</hi> which God gave for that time, and by him to be fulfilled, and ſo ended, to your requiring us to conform to you in that, or thoſe Things which God never ordained? as Sprinkling of Infants; and not only ſo, but teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Doctrine, That you make them thereby the Children of God, Members of Chriſt, and Heirs of his Kingdom; and alſo your giving <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms in Rhime and Meeter, to the wicked World, to ſing to God's diſhonour: And to hear a proud Man, and covetous Man (who is an Idolater) Preach and Pray, whom God never ſent; yea, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in his Sins, contrary to all Reaſon and Religion; alſo how can we conform to you in your Corruptions of reſpecting Perſons, and of having Mens Perſons in Admiration becauſe of Advantage? Contrary to the expreſs Doctrine of the Apoſtle, which ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 2.1, &amp;c. <hi>Have not the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Glory, with reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> Yea, and plead for their Tranſgreſſions: How can we Conform to ſuch, as under the Name of Chriſtians, do live manifeſtly in the Sins of the Heathen; as <hi>Fornication, Covetouſneſs, Idolatry, Drunkenneſs, and are Railers, and Extertioners, and lovers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God:</hi> from whom the Apoſtle bids us <hi>turn away?</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 11, &amp;c. with whom he forbids us to eat; and yet with ſuch, both <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>Bryan,</hi> for all their former ſeeming hypocritical Zeal, would now have us to Communicate, yet not ſo much as conſent to their Corruptions, neither as their daubing contradicting Doctrine ſeems willing to have. Then I ſay, We muſt neither have Fellowſhip with them in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip-actions, (as <hi>R. B.</hi> calls them) nor in their ordinary Converſation, for all is Corrupt: For what greater Aſſent or Conſent can we give, than by joyning with them, or practiſing ſuch things openly: But it's better to obey God than Man, both in this and all things; and as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſo in this caſe hath he ſaid to us: <hi>Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to thee, but return not thou to them;</hi> for what Fellowſhip hath Light with Darkneſs, or the Temple of God with Idols?</p>
                  <p>And now I come a little to ſet before you poor People, who have been deceived by ſuch Men as this <hi>R.

                  </p>
                  <p>But now ſee the wretched Anſwer of this <hi>Bryan</hi> to the ſaid Objection of the old Non-conformiſts.</p>

His anſwer is, by Sprinkling, when Infants, or for fear of Man: But what, are theſe Calls into the Viſible Church? A ſtrange Church muſt that needs be for certain, where People are called into it without God's Word; for certain it's none of God's Church, into which People are called, without his Word: It's the viſible Company of ſuch as know not God, thou ſhouldſt have ſaid: For God's Church are the Faithful, and their Faith cometh by Hearing,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97179:162"/>and Hearing by the Word of God, and not without it: But, oh the Deſolation that ſuch Doctrine as this of <hi>Bryan</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> hath made amongſt the poor People, whoſe Eyes are not fully opened to ſee their Deceits.</p>
                  <p>Alſo this Antichriſtian Doctrine being laid as a Foundation in their Houſe, it is no Wonder to hear this <hi>Bryan</hi> ſay, Page 301.

                  <p>But by all theſe unſound, unchriſtian and ignorant Sayings, it fully appears, that this <hi>Bryan</hi> is one of them who have neither ſeen nor known Chriſt; ſeeing he would bring in the Heathen into the Temple without the Word: And ſo, Who is more Ignorant and Prophane than this Prieſt <hi>Bryan</hi> himſelf, as alſo his Brother <hi>R. B.</hi> who is not aſhamed to make ſuch a one a Tutor, or Father of Miniſters, who is ignorant of the very Door and Entrance into the Church, and of Chriſt's ſecond Coming? Nay, who is ignorant of his firſt Appearance, which was for Judgment, even to whip the Buyers and Sellers, and all Prophane ones, out of his Houſe, as he ſaid himſelf, <hi>For Judgment come I into this World.</hi> What Paſtors or Teachers can ſuch Tutor, as are ſo ignorant of Chriſt's Kingdom; and ſo admit the Ignorant and Prophane into their Church, (or Cage of unclean Birds) for the Church of Chriſt, which is viſibly ſeen, and known by the Spiritual Eye to be his Body, is Holy, and into it can no unclean thing enter, as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. but into the World's Church, may both Ignorant and Prophane enter and dwell: But at ſuch diſhoneſt Gain, as is gotten by ſuch Doctrines as this of <hi>Bryan</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> hath the Lord long ſhaken his Hand: Is this your Ware that you ſell to the People at ſo dear a Rate? Is this your Straw and Stubble that you ſeed them with? But no Man of any Underſtanding in Heavenly Matters, will buy any more of your Merchandize. For God is come to teach his People himſelf, and the Spirit of God is felt and witneſſed amongſt us, praiſed be God; yea, and in our very Hearts to teach us, and by which we feel Chriſt come again the ſecond Time, without Sin, to Salvation, according to his Holy Promiſes, and by whoſe all-powerful Word of Faith and Heavenly Preſence in us, are we joyned together unto him, in one Holy Body; Glory to his Name over all, for he is worthy.</p>
                  <p>And for that Saying, <hi>That Chriſtian Princes have not leſs Power to aboliſh Idolatry, and by Law and Penalties, to compel the Subjects in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where there is a parity of reaſon, than the Jewiſh Kings under that Law had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer and ſay, That all are not Chriſtians who are ſo called; and this crying up the Worldly Magiſtrates Power in Matters Spiritual, is the only In-let into Perſecution of the Tender-hearted People of God,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97179:162"/>who cannot bow to every thing the World ſets up; yea, though it come under the name or ſhew of Chriſtian Religion; and if the Image be of Gold never ſo goodly, yet wanting Life and Power they cannot bow to it. I ſay, They who Preach up the Worldly Princes, under what Name ſoever, to have Power over the Conſciences of People in Matters purely Spiritual (as the whole Body of Chriſtian Religion is) are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and the great Enemies of that Liberty which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for his People, and which the Apoſtles ſealed unto with their Blood, ſaying in ſuch caſes, <hi>Let every Man be fully perſwaded in his own Heart.</hi> And who art thou that judges (much leſs forceſt and compelleſt as <hi>Bryan</hi> and <hi>R B</hi>'s Doctrine would have it) another? to his own Maſter (to wit, God the Judge of all) he ſtandeth or falleth, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. at large; but what account will thoſe Daubers give to the Lord, for all the Innocent Blood they have cauſed to be ſhed theſe many hundred Years? is Sad to conſider: For though ſuch Magiſtrates as are evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined are not free, yet the Falſe Teachers, who by their Lies ſtir up, yea, and bring forth that evil Inclination into real Actings againſt the Good, ſhall receive the greater Condemnation: And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Evil, both in the one and in the other, the Lord will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly carry on his great Work to his own Praiſe, which he hath begun, Glory to his Name for ever: And the Beaſt, Whore and Falſe Prophet, ſhall alive together be caſt into the Lake prepared for them, and into the Pit which they had digged for others.</p>
                  <p>Alſo whereas he ſaith, <hi>That it ſufficeth that we have Examples in the Old Teſtament for the Magiſtrates Power in Church matters, though none in the New Teſtament.</hi> I ſay, It is no more true, than if we ſhould reaſon for an outward worldly Temple, Sacrifices, and Circumciſion now, becauſe there is Examples of theſe things in the Old Teſtament; and for Revenge and Retaliation now, becauſe it is mentioned in the Old, contrary to Chriſt, <hi>For though it hath been ſaid of old</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; yet I ſay to you, my Diſciples, under the New Covenant, If any Man ſmite you on the one Cheek, turn to him the other;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves; but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>if thy Enemy hunger, ſeed him,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo Chriſt being come, and all Power in Heaven and Earth given him; Is not he in theſe Spiritual Matters, relating to the very Soul and Conſcience, the only Lord, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and King, and Supreme, and ought of right to rule in his own Houſe and Temple, which is in Man, and thoſe that will not that he ſhould Rule, muſt bow before him, and be aſhamed before his Face.</p>
                  <p>So that now the Son of God being come, and ſeated by right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, the true King and Heir upon <hi>David</hi>'s Throne, to Rule in Righteouſneſs for ever in the Hearts of his Children, he commands the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97179:163"/>true Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to obey his Heavenly Voice, Law and Doctrine, ſpoken and written within, as thoſe outward and typical Kings did, command the fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to keep <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, written without; and as thoſe that obeyed not that outward Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were lyable to the Puniſhment of that Law; ſo they now that obey not Chriſt's Spiritual Law, written in the Heart and Conſcience by his Holy Power, are lyable to the Eternal Judgment of Jeſus Chriſt, the Judge of Quick and Dead, as he ſaith, <hi>The Father judges no Man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment to the Son:</hi> And as for the worldly Magiſtrate, he is to Rule in outward things, betwixt Man and Man, to ſee that every one, as to the Body and outward Eſtate, be well behaved one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to bear the Sword in vain, as hath been too much in uſe, even amongſt many called Chriſtian Magiſtrates, as well as others; from whence it hath come to paſs, that for the ſake of the Poor, whom the worldly Powers have oppreſſed, as well in Temporals as Spirituals, the Lord hath overturned them, one Sort after another, as they were found in the Abuſe of that Power and Truſt which was put into their Hands, for the Protection of, and Encouragement and Praiſe of the Good, and Puniſhment of the Evil doers; but not the contrary, according to that of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, till he come whoſe Right it is:</hi> And ſo until Truth, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Equity and Juſtice rule, both in the Hearts and Lives of the Children of Men, there will neither be Peace, nor Eſtabliſhment of any good thing; but as a Wheel will the whole Earth be, from Generation to Generation, ſaith the Spirit, who is the ſweet Orderer in all things, for the Holy Seed's ſake: Glory to his Name for ever.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in the Love and Kindneſs of the Lord God, have I been thus enabled for the Truth, and the poor Peoples ſake, to lay open ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Deceits, and groſs Hypocriſie, of theſe two Men, called <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>Bryan,</hi> who have long, under a Cover or Vizard of Holineſs, deceived the unſtable Souls of many: But now the Covering being rent off, their Wolfiſh Nature is fully manifeſt: Glory to the Lord, the good Work-man over all for ever, So be it.</p>

                     <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the Idolatry Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Church of</hi> Rome.</head>
                  <p>A Book coming to my Hands, called, <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the Idolatry Practiſed in the Church of</hi> Rome: Written by <hi>E. S.</hi> Stiled D. D. And finding the Man Zealous againſt that Romiſh Idolatry, which is Commendable in him: <hi>E. S.</hi> in his Book, <hi>Orig. Sacra.</hi> Page 4. hath theſe words, <hi>God Created the Souls of Men, not only Capable of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Truth of things, but furniſhed him with a Sufficient Teacher to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Truth from Falſhood, by a LIGHT ſet up in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; which, if he had attended to, he might have ſecured himſelf from all Impoſtors and Deceit.</hi> And alſo finding in his Principles, towards the latter end of his Book, ſuch a ſaying as this, to wit, his fifth Priciple; <hi>There can be no other means Imagined, whereby we are to judge of the Truth of Divine Revelation, but a faculty in us diſcerning Truth and Falſhood in Matters Propoſed to our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings; which, if we do not Exerciſe in Judging the Truth of Divine Revelation, we muſt be impoſed upon by every thing that pretends to be ſo.</hi> And in <hi>Article</hi> 13. <hi>The Holy Scriptures may be underſtood Infallibly by all Perſons, who ſincerely endeavour to know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, in all ſuch things as are neceſſary for their Salvation.</hi> This is the Scope of the latter part of that Article. And in <hi>Article</hi> 13. <hi>And there can be no ſufficient Reaſon given, why that may not ſerve in matters of Faith, which God himſelf hath made uſe of, as the means, to keep Men from Sin in their Lives, unleſs any imagine, that Errors in Opinion are far more Dangerous to Mens Souls than a vicious Life is; and therefore that God is bound to take more Care to prevent the one than the other.</hi> And in his Fourth and Fifth Concluſion, upon his <hi>Articles,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The more abſurd any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are, and Repugnant to the firſt Principles of Senſe and Reaſon; which any Church Obtrudes upon the Faith of Men: The greater Reaſon Men ſtill have to reject the pretence of Infallibility in that Church, as a grand Impoſture. And ſo, to diſown what is ſo Taught by ſuch a Church, is not to queſtion the Veracity of God, but ſo firmly to adhere to it; as to what he hath Revealed in Scriptures, that Men dare not, out of Love to their Souls, reject what is ſo taught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet finding this <hi>E. S.</hi> making ſeveral Reflections upon us, whom the World Scorn, under the Nick name of <hi>Quakers;</hi> I ſay, us whom the Lord hath drawn out of the many Waters of Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> into
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97179:164"/>the Light of his Son, that moſt inward Principle, Faculty, and alone Ability in Man, to try all Doctrines and Works by; I could not but thus write ſomething to him, that he might ſee his Miſtake of us, and not loſe his Reward of ſtanding againſt Romiſh Deluſions, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Speaking againſt the Truth of God, made manifeſt to us in our Hearts, and Shining forth in our Lives, to the Praiſe of his Glory, and the Good of all who do rightly underſtand us, and receive our Teſtimony; I ſay, that if poſſible he may underſtand a little, and feel of that inward Principle, or Faculty (as he calls it) which he is aiming at, and which, he ſaith, muſt be antecedently ſuppoſed (<hi>viz.</hi> neceſſarily) to all Divine Revelation, are theſe things writ.</p>
                  <p>Now that part of his Book, where he ſome-what ſmites at us; is, that where he Treats of the <hi>Fanaticiſm of the Roman Church:</hi> As one may ſee Page 249. where he ſays, <hi>Who will not take pains to ſee how Faithfully I have Tranſlated theſe Words out of</hi> Eymericus, <hi>would imagine I have borrowed ſome of the canting Language of the Modern</hi> Quakers. Look * where he goes on.</p>
                  <p>Now, What is this ſome of this canting Language? That part of <hi>Petrus Johannis</hi>'s Relation of St. <hi>Francis</hi> (as he calls him) runs thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That thoſe who Oppoſed this Order</hi> (to wit, of that <hi>Francis</hi>) <hi>were the Carnal Perſecuting Clergy, in whom the Seat of the Beaſt is much more than in the People; that in the time of the Myſtical Antichriſt, the Carnal Church ſhall oppoſe the Doctrine, Life and Zeal of the Saints, and burn as it were with Fire againſt them; but it ſhall be dried up from all Spiritual Wiſdom, and Grace, and the Riches of Chriſt; and be Expoſed to Errors and Deluſion, and as it was with the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks. Thus far there.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, What is this kind of Language Canting, where it is truly applied in any Age; doſt not thou, <hi>Edward Stillingfleet,</hi> believe that there both was, and is a Carnal Church, that did and doth oppoſe the Doctrine, Life and Zeal of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is there ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t down. To let <hi>Francis</hi> and his Applauders alone, we know both the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt mentioned in Scripture; as alſo Chriſt himſelf did vehemently Cry againſt a Carnal Church, or Fleſhly Company of Profeſſors in thoſe days; for he that was born after the Fleſh did always Perſecute him that was born after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, both before, and in the Apoſtles Days. And ſo it hath been ſince, no queſtion, all along downwards; and as we for certain find it ſo in theſe our days, not only by the Papiſts, but even amongſt them called Proteſtants alſo: And was thoſe many Sharp Reproofs, and large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Falſe Teachers in the Prophets and Apoſtles time <hi>Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> O Man! take heed, thou knows not what thou doſt, when thou judges our Witneſs againſt the Falſe Teachers, and Carnal Profeſſors
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97179:164"/>of this Age no better than Canting: But certainly, though ſome of <hi>you</hi> may put it off at preſent, as a light thing, and look at it Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as no better than Canting; as they did, who ſaid, <hi>He is Mad, and hath a Devil, why hear ye him; but the time will come when it will be otherwiſe, even then when the Books are opened, and every one receives a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to their Deeds.</hi> It is ſtrange, this Doctor, who ſeems to be ſo much Read, ſhould Read our Principles no better, and pretending to ſo much Wiſdom, if he have Read our Books, that he ſhould no better underſtand us, than to compare us to ſuch as him, called St. <hi>Francis, Ignatius Loyola;</hi> or the Upholders of that Rotten and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Kingdom of Popery: But we are not greater than our Lord, <hi>who was Crucified between the Thieves, and of whom they ſaid, he is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, and a Friend of Publicans and Sinners: But Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children;</hi> Praiſed be God, though others, who are not ſome of the Heavenly Wiſdom, ſpeak ever ſo ill of it. Alſo this <hi>Edward Stilling fleet,</hi> Page 252. of his Book, ſaith, <hi>Their Doctrines</hi> (to wit, thoſe of <hi>Francis</hi>'s Order it ſeems) <hi>may be Reduced to theſe Four Heads; Firſt,</hi> Evangelical Poverty. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unlawfulneſs of Swearing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Doctrine of Perfection. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Oppoſition to the Carnal Church: <hi>Which, being joyned with that great Degree of Light, which they ſuppoſed themſelves to have above all the reſt of the World, makes a Sect of</hi> Quakers, <hi>after the Order of St.</hi> Francis.</p>
                  <p>Now to this I ſay, That if ſuch Doctrines as theſe, not in <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Petrus Johannis</hi>'s Sence, but in the Truth of the thing, be plainly found Aſſerted and Exhorted unto in Scripture by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, then I hope they, who Revile us for ſuch things, do not do it to us only, but even to Truth it ſelf, and muſt be accountable to him in Judgment for it: As for the Order of <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Dominicus,</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or what other of <hi>Popiſh Sects</hi> there be, through the Grace of Chriſt we are, taught to deny them all, together with all thoſe Orders amongſt them, called Proteſtants, which would make the Seamleſs Coat of Chriſt of many Pieces, and ſo ſpoil all, for Chriſt's Body is one, the choſen Ones of God, precious to him. And of his Heavenly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ody, it is our Glory and our Crown to he found Members; and our Faith being Builded upon the Living Rock, Chriſt Jeſus, in Deed and Truth, we know the Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it: But what art thou againſt true Goſpel Poverty, and Perfection, and Light; and ſuch a Friend to Swearing, and the Carnal Church, that thoſe now amongſt us that hold the one, and deny the other, muſt be holden no leſs than Papiſts for it: Our Judgment of theſe things it generally known, and of the Lord Jeſus allowed, and that's our Peace; and ſo in particular at preſent, I ſpeak not much, but only
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:97179:165"/>gladly would let <hi>E. S.</hi> ſee how he hath wronged himſelf, by numbring us with he knows not whom; but however Reported to him, (if as the Vileſt amongſt the Vile) it were this Author's Wiſdom to weigh his words better, and be more ſolid for time to come.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I take notice of one ſaying of this Authors, in Page 256. where he ſaith, (that ſome Phanatick <hi>Papiſts</hi> held) amongſt other things, That <hi>every Intellectual Being</hi> (doth he not mean Man's Soul) <hi>hath enough within it ſelf to make it happy, or</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Light within.</hi> Theſe words <hi>[or a Light within]</hi> ſeem to be put in on purpoſe, that People may take notice whom he would have them believe they reſemble: But it ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, that this Man ſhould any ways ſpeak ſlightly of our Teſtimony to the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt in Man, ſeeing he hath Confeſſed ſo much as is before ſet down in his Principles of an inward Law, neceſſarily Antecedent to all Divine Revelation, as the Judge thereof in Man. And is not that inward Law, the Light of God and Chriſt in Man: For what other Light can judge aright of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? O how often is this to be found true amongſt Men, that they will ſeem in words to confeſs to that which indeed they are againſt; for want of a true underſtanding of their own words?</p>
                  <p>And whereas he mentions Chriſt's being Spiritually Crucified in ſome that ſuffered in the next Page, as ſuch a one relates: Whatſoever the thing was to them, ſurely the Expreſſion is not Canting; for Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Saul, Why Perſecutes thou me?</hi> And ſome are ſaid to Crucifie Chriſt afreſh to themſelves; and the Witneſſes lay ſlain in the Streets of the great City, which Spiritually is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where our Lord was Crucified, which he that hath an Ear may hear. But indeed Spiritual Expreſſions could never be reliſhed by the Unſpiritual Mind.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in Page 273. this <hi>E. S.</hi> telling of one <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> That it's reported of him, <hi>That it was his Cuſtom not to give Men any Titles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but to call them only by their Common Names; and particularly, that he would not put off his Hat when he was brought before a Commander,</hi> ſays, <hi>by this we underſtand who was the firſt Founder of that Phanatick Sect among us, which is diſtinguiſhed ſo much from others, by denying Common Civilities to Men.</hi> Alſo Page 275. telling of this <hi>Ignatius</hi> further, ſaith, <hi>After he was committed to cloſe Priſon, he preached to the People with great Zeal, who now flock in great numbers to him; and gloried as much in his Sufferings, and talked at the ſame rate that the Ringleaders of the</hi> Quakers <hi>are wont to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and juſt with the ſame reſolution; for when the reſt of the Priſoners made an eſcape through the Negligence of the Keepers,</hi> Ignatius <hi>and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions would not ſtir; when they were called to Anſwer,</hi> Ignatius <hi>preached at large upon ſeveral Points of Divinity to them, under pretence of anſwering Queſtions.</hi> And ſaith, <hi>They preached in the Streets and Market-places,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:97179:165"/>and on Bulks of Shops for their Pulpits; and though few underſtood them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strangers, yet all admired and commended them; and no doubt,</hi> faith this Author, <hi>they Converted many, as their Followers have done, from the uſe of Laces and Ribbands.</hi> I anſwer, then ſurely this is more than the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pariſh-prieſts then did, or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prieſts now do.</p>
                  <p>And in Page 281, and 282, concludes, <hi>And now let the World judge, whether there hath appeared a greater Enthuſiaſt, or Pretender to Revelations, than</hi> Ignatius <hi>was, ſince the Days of</hi> Mahomet <hi>and St.</hi> Francis? <hi>Methinks they might be aſhamed to upbraid us with the Phanaticiſm of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and ſuch Perſons, the Chiefeſt of whom fall very much ſhort of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>in thoſe very things for which they are Condemn'd by us, yet any who compares them, would imagine the Life of</hi> Ignatius <hi>had been their great Exemplar: I know not whether any of that Innocent and Religious Order of the Jeſuits, had any hand in forming this New Society among us, as hath been frequently ſuggeſted.</hi> Page 258. <hi>But if one may gueſs the Father by the Child's likeneſs,</hi> Ignatius Loyola, <hi>the Founder of the Jeſuits, was at leaſt the Grandfather of the</hi> Quakers.</p>
                  <p>He goes on, ſaying, <hi>That as</hi> Vaſthi <hi>the Queen being caſt off from the Kingdom and Marriage of</hi> Ahaſhuerus, <hi>the humble</hi> Eſther <hi>was choſen to ſucceed in her place; and the King made a great Feaſt to his Princes and Servants, ſo in this laſt ſtate of the Church, the Adulterous</hi> Babylon, <hi>the Carnal Church being rejected, the Spiritual Church muſt be exalted, and a great Spiritual Feaſt be kept to Celebrate theſe Nuptials with: That under the Myſtical Antichriſt there ſhall be Overturnings and Commotions, by which the Carnal Church ſhall be terribly ſtirred up and moved againſt the Evangelical Spirit of Chriſt, but that the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>the Carnal Church, ſhall fall, in which time the Saints ſhall preach, ſaying, From this time it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan, and the Habitation of Devils, which before ſaid in the Pride of her Heart, I ſit as a Queen in great Honour and Glory, I Rule over my Kingdom, I ſit at eaſe, I am no Widow,</hi> i. e. <hi>I have Biſhops and Kings on my ſide: That the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is that Great Whore ſpoken of in the</hi> Revelations, <hi>which hath committed Fornication with this World, having departed from the Worſhip, and ſincere Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Chriſt her Spouſe, and embraced the World, the Riches and Pleaſures of it, and the Devil, and Kings, and Princes, and Prelates, and all the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo Page 285. <hi>For if we have no other Helps for the underſtanding of their Prayer of Contemplation, than what Mr.</hi> Creſſy <hi>gives in his</hi> Preface, <hi>we may as well hope to underſtand the</hi> Quakers <hi>Canting as Mr.</hi> Creſſy<hi>'s.</hi> And this Author, Page 289. ſaith, <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught Men a plain and intelligible way of ſerving God, and bid them look for Perfection in another World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:97179:166"/>
                  <p>Alſo Page 295. telling of ſome <hi>Romiſh</hi> Phanaticks, ſays, <hi>Did not they deliver this for their Doctrine, that Men ought to harken to the immediate Impulſes of the Spirit of God within them; and that now God doth acquaint his own People with his Mind and Will in a way peculiar to themſelves.</hi> And ſays afterwards, <hi>That our Enthuſiaſts do not boaſt of ſo many Raptures, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Revelations, as thoſe of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>have done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to this I ſay, that when any of thoſe that pretend to be Head of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, are come to ſuch a paſs and meaſure of Darkneſs, as that they cannot allow that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to harken to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Impulſes of the Spirit of God within them, or that now God doth acquaint his own People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay it is ſad, and the Times may well be ſaid to be perilous indeed. What! Doth either the Scripture without, or the inward Faculty, which thou ſays muſt be Antecedent to all Divine Revelation, Dictate to thee, that theſe Sayings are Phanatical? What! Are not the Children of God led by the Spirit of God which is in them? And muſt they not harken to the Doctrine and Movings of their Teacher and Leader? And doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>to you,</hi> to wit, my peculiar People and Diſciples, <hi>it is given to know the Myſtery of the Kingdom of God;</hi> but to others it is not given, to wit, to thoſe that are without, that follow their Wiſdom, and not Chriſt's Spirit: But both the Carnal Church of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny to harken to the inward Movings or Impulſes, as are here called, of God's Spirit, that they may Eſtabliſh their own Traditions, ſome in one way, ſome in another, but all in vain; for the Lamb ſhall have the Victory, and a little Child ſhall lead them, and the Meek ſhall increaſe their Joy in the Lord; and he, the Lord, whom the World deſpiſes, ſhall lead them by the Fountain of Living Water.</p>
                  <p>But let me ask this Doctor this Serious Queſtion, whether he accounts that part of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Phanaticiſm here ſet down, or the Common Tenets of them called the Orthodox among them, the better Doctrine? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Two, this he calls Phanaticiſm is the more favoured by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo conſequently the more Orthodox; and may I not ſay, the more <hi>Proteſtant</hi> too? For the firſt Reformers pretended to take Scripture for their Rule, though in many things they miſſed it ſadly.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97179:169"/>And Bleſſed are they, and they only, that walk in the Light of God's Holy City, into which no unclean thing can ever enter.

And take heed of applying thoſe Scriptures to your ſelves whilſt you live in Sin, which belong only to ſuch as witneſs Redemption from Sin; as thoſe words in that 95th <hi>Pſalm</hi> following do, which ſay, <hi>O come let us ſing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoyce in the ſtrength of our Salvation, for he is the Lord our God, and we are the People of his Paſture, and Sheep of his hands,</hi> &amp;c. O ſtand in awe of God, O People, and do no more ſo preſumptuouſly, for his Sheep you are not, who are ſo Deaf to his Voice, and ſo Rebellious to his Word, as you have and do daily every way manifeſt your ſelves to be: O what Salvation can ſuch witneſs, as are ſo deep in their Sins; for Chriſt Saves his People from their Sins, from their Diſobedience, from being miſerable Offenders, and is the Saving Health of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Anointed ones, he leaves them not in the Darkneſs where the Sin is committed, but brings all his Followers to the Light of Life, where the ever Bleſſed, and Holy, and perfect, and acceptable Will of God, is both known and done; and then of ſuch it is truly ſaid, They are the Sheep of Chriſt's Paſture, a Royal Prieſt-hood, a peculiar People indeed, to the Praiſe of God's Glory, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things are in your Morning Service, as you call it, and your Evening being ſo much like it, we paſs it over, and proceed to what follows; only this may be taken notice of by the way in all your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whereas there is often repeated thoſe words, <hi>Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: As it was in the Beginning,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, Glory was not ſo given to God in the Beginning, as it is by you at this day, that is to ſay, In Form and Cuſtom, and in a dead Mind; for in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning living Praiſes from a living Sence of what God had done for their Souls, was given to God: And as it was then, ſo it is at this day, by the living Members of Chriſt's Heavenly Body, as is ſaid before, and ever ſhall be, by ſuch Saved Ones: But the ſtrange Children will Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they do at this day.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I may take notice of as a thing of Concernment, becauſe it is as the very Door and In-let into your defiled Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is that your Sprinkling, which you call Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which is ſo unſcriptural and corrupt a Cuſtom, both for Matter and Manner, that the Lord's Spirit in theſe days (wherein Truth is ſo gloriouſly ariſen) is ſo burdened with, that he will not long forbear to judge you for it. For firſt, you bring in a little Infant as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97179:170"/>of your Baptiſm, which by your own Confeſſion in your Catechiſm, cannot perform the things required of Perſons to be Baptized: For it's ſaid, <hi>What is required of Perſons to be Baptized?</hi> Your anſwer is, <hi>Repentance, whereby they forſake Sin; and Faith, whereby they believe the Promiſes of God made to them in that buſineſs.</hi> And therefore when it is further demanded, <hi>Why then are Infants baptized, when by reaſon of their tender Age they cannot perform them?</hi> Your anſwer is, <hi>Yes, they do perform them by their Sureties.</hi> And then you bring in your Sureties, which very unchriſtianly you call God-fathers and God-mothers, to promiſe and vow ſuch things for the Child, as you never did to this day do for your ſelves, that is, <hi>To forſake the Devil and all his Works,</hi> &amp;c. But I ask, Who hath required this at your Hands, that you ſhould ſo promiſe for them? Certainly God never required it of you, for it is contrary to his Pure and Holy Nature, to lay ſuch an Impoſſibility upon you, to wit, That you ſhould promiſe that for others, which, of your ſelves, you have no power to do for your ſelves; and alſo becauſe he knows it is againſt the Glory of his Chriſt, who is the only Surety, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker and Mediator betwixt God and Man. And certainly if you and your Teachers were not utterly given up to Darkneſs, you could never adventure your Souls in ſuch a thing; for now it's well known amongſt Men, what the Nature of a Surety is, for he is liable to pay the Debt if the Principal fail, as if it were his own Debt. Now ſeeing it's manifeſt that there is a Failing in the Infant, as to the Performance of this Bond, to wit, Of <hi>forſaking the Devil and all his Works, Pomps and Vanities of the evil World, and all the ſinful Deſires of the Fleſh:</hi> And ſeeing that the Wages, Reward or Puniſhment for Sin is Death, Are you bold Sureties willing to dye the Death for the Child? for indeed you deſerve it more than the Child, for it never undertook it, and ſo never as yet brought it ſelf under the actual and perſonal Ingagement for the Debt. O! conſider, conſider, this is a meer Mocking of God, but God will not be mocked, for if you repent not of this, and all your other Sins, he will vex you in his Wrath. And then for that other great Error, whereby the blind Guides would ſeem to make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Infant, by this ſorry doing of theirs, is regenerate, and made an Inheritor of God's Kingdom: It is ſuch a piece of Popery and Groſſneſs of Darkneſs, that it's much they fear not that the Earth ſhould open and ſwallow them up, for their Preſumption, as it did <hi>Core:</hi> For where did ever God, by his Son, Prophet or Apoſtle, ever give them any ground in Scripture for ſuch Judgment; for Regeneration is ſuch a worthy Work of God upon the Soul, that it cannot be done, but though the Incorruptible Seed of the Word of God, which lives and endures for ever in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:97179:170"/>
                  <p>But theſe bold and blind Teachers, ruſhing like the Horſe into the Battle, are not afraid to ſay, and that generally concerning every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant which they Sprinkle, that they are Regenerated; and ſo preſume to give God Thanks for it; as though without queſtion it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo; when as indeed they do not at all know whether any thing at all be done to the Childs Soul by it or no: And ſurely this muſt needs be a high Preſumption, to Father that upon the pure and holy God, which he never promiſed to do by ſuch a means upon ſuch a ſubject, as by the Scriptures and Doctrine of Faith is moſt manifeſt. And for thoſe Scriptures which they would colour the Matter over to you with, makes nothing for it. They alledge, Chriſt took little Children in his Arms, and bleſſed them; therefore they are regenerated by the Prieſt's Sprinkling: Is this good reaſoning, I ſay this is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for Chriſt did neither Waſh nor Sprinkle them with any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Water at all, but laid his Hands on them and Bleſſed them that came to him. But bringing them to the Hireling Prieſt, I am ſure no wiſe Man will ſay, is bringing them to Chriſt. And ſo let the little Infants alone whilſt Infants, and when they are capable of Doctrine, let them be brought by true Faith to Chriſt, and he will bleſs them now as then; for nothing but the Prayer of Faith can do them any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at all in this weighty Matter until then. So this meddling with Children above this meaſure of Truth and Faith, is great Preſumption. Again ſaith the Prieſt (who would be Saved himſelf by ſome outward Obſervation or means of Words or Water, or the like, if it could be) did not Chriſt ſay, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein.</hi> So ſay I alſo: But what is this to their Cuſtom of Sprinkling the Fleſh with Water, and their Doctrine of Regeneration thereupon? I ſay, nothing at all; For the Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is only here ſet forth by way of Similitude, to ſhew what harmleſs, paſſive, low-minded Things thoſe are, who enters into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>But Fleſh and Blood,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, enters not, neither doth Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption inherit Incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15 50. And as for the natural Infants, though they be harmleſs as to Men, yet they generally hold, that by Nature they are not Harmleſs and without Sin in God's ſight, and ſo as ſuch, are not fit Subjects of God's Kingdom. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſuch a thing as this, ſaith, <hi>All are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>which are of</hi> Iſrael (though outwardly Circumciſed.) <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called. That is, They which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> Ye may as well, yea better, conclude, That all who came of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, and were outwardly Circumciſed, were
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97179:171"/>Saved (becauſe Circumciſion was commanded for the Children to which outward Baptiſm was not) as that all Coming of Parents, called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and outwardly Sprinkled, are Saved (and that for the outward ſake) as you in your Doctrine moſt preſumptuouſly do: But here the Apoſtle gives all ſuch Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as he ſaith in another place, <hi>It's neither Circumciſion nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion avails any thing in this great matter, but a new Creature.</hi> So may we as truly ſay to all ſuch this day, who place no leſs than Salvation it ſelf upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm, that it is neither ſuch Baptizing, nor Unbaptizing, that avails any thing to God's Kingdom, but a new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus, for it is ſaid, <hi>He that Believes and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved: But he that Believes not, is condemned already.</hi> But he doth not ſay, He that is not Baptized with outward Water ſhall be Damned, or is Condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And we, through Grace, know there is a Baptiſm of the Spirit, whereby all the Members of Chriſt are Baptized by one Spirit into one Body, Glory to God, who hath given us Victory over the Beaſt, Whore and Falſe Prophet. But you will ſay, perhaps, then, What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our Children? I ſay, if thou knoweſt not, ſtay till God make it known unto thee; for Secret things belong to God, things Revealed tous. But it is no where ſaid, That all that come of ſuch as are called Chriſtians outwardly, and are not Sprinkled after the Cuſtom of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and dye before they commit actual Sin, are excluded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, as the Ignorant and Preſumptuous may imagine; but as they grow capable of Doctrine, we ought to inſtruct them in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo nurture them up in his Fear, to know him in them, and what he is to them in their Hearts by Faith, as is in part ſaid before, ſo ſhall no Uncircumciſed or Unclean in Heart, be brought into God's Church; neither ſhall the Hireling make a Prey upon the People any more; but the Church ſhall be as in the Beginning, when it was called the Spouſe of Chriſt, a Royal not a Defiled Prieſthood, a Choſen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (not the unchoſen and unclean World a peculiar People (and not the whole World, who in their Uncleanneſs, can get into the Talk of Chriſtian Religion, to the great Diſhonour of God, who is burdened with the Manners of ſuch People as cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and leaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually undone the Lord's Holy Commandments.)</p>
                  <p>And now that you who read theſe Lines, may ponder a little further of what I ſay, I may here ſet down ſomewhat more of the Prieſt's deceivable words at their Sprinkling of Infants, as you may find them in the Book: For thus ſaith the Prieſt to the People, <hi>Dearly B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leaſe it of its Sins, to Sanctifie it with the Holy Chriſt, to give it the Kingdom of Heaven and everlaſting Life: Ye
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97179:171"/>have heard alſo how Chriſt hath promiſed in his Goſpel to grant all theſe things, which ye have prayed for.</hi> (Stay, I ſay, and be afraid for this Boldneſs, for there is no ſuch Promiſe in the Goſpel, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will give Eternal Life to any, much leſs to all that the Hypocrites and open Prophane Sinners pray for, for their Prayers ſake; who do all with one Mouth and Conſent, daily Confeſs they have no Health in them, but are Miſerable Offenders, living in the continual Breach of God's Commandments, and even angry in their Minds to hear any profeſs and witneſs a better State; ſo it was moſt truly ſaid, God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not People living in Sin, <hi>but if any be a Doer of God's Will, him God heareth, John</hi> 9.) So, People, you may ſee your Teachers frame Deceit, and would have you believe their Untruths. But the Prieſt goes on, and ſaith, <hi>Which Promiſe he for his part will moſt ſurely keep and perform. Wherefore after this Promiſe made by Chriſt</hi> (ſilence Fleſh, there is no ſuch Promiſe made upon this account) <hi>this Infant muſt alſo faithfully, for his part, promiſe by you that are his Sureties, (until he come to Age to take it upon himſelf) that he will Renounce the Devil and all his Works, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe God's Holy Word, and obediently keep his Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So now by this all may ſee that theſe Prieſts, for all their great talk of Regenerating by their Baptiſm, it ſtands only upon a Condition, that the Child muſt perform faithfully what is promiſed on their part. And ſo they do not believe their own Doctrine, when they ſay in their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, without any if or and, That the Child was in its Baptiſm made an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven: And ſo in Unbelief and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts do they preſume to give Thanks, when they ſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that they give God Thanks that he hath Regenerated the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. If they had prayed only that he would do it, and ſo have left it, it had been leſs, but to conclude that it is abſolutely done, only becauſe they have ſprinkled it, and ſaid a few words over it, and the Covenant on the Child's part yet unperformed, this is great Preſumption, and a grievous taking of God's Name in vain. And here alſo is manifeſt a grievous Error, that they cannot ſtay until the Child can promiſe for it ſelf, if there muſt needs be ſprinkling and promiſing, but they muſt bring in others, without all Scripture and Reaſon, to promiſe for them: For I do poſitively affirm as before, that God never required it at any ones Hand ſo to do; for beſides, that there is no Scripture for it, it is greatly againſt Chriſt, who is the alone Surety and Mediator betwixt God and Man, but it hath been a Cuſtom meerly introduced amongſt People called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the dark Night of Apoſtacy, when Popery began, which now in the clear ſhining of the Sun of Righteouſneſs upon People again, is done, and daily to be done away, Glory to the Lord for Ever.</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:97179:172"/>
                  <p>But the Prieſt goes on, demanding of the Sureties (which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall out to be ſome wanton Boy or Girl, or ſome other Notorious Evil-liver of Riper Years.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doſt thou in the Name of this Child renounce the Devil and all his Works, the vain Pomp and Glory of the World, with all Covetous Deſires of the ſame, and the Carnal Deſires of the Fleſh, ſo that thou wilt not follow, nor be led by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then theſe Ignorant Sureties, of what ſort ſoever, being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtructed by the Prieſt, muſt Anſwer, <hi>I Renounce them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What! People, are ye all Dead, or faſt aſleep, that ye never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch things as theſe, but ruſh like a Horſe into the Battel without fear, into ſuch weighty Matters as theſe? Were it not fit that ſuch who promiſe ſo boldly ſo great Matters for others, were firſt looked into whether ever they did half, nay, the hundredth part of ſo much for themſelves, but where the Blind leads the Blind, what leſs than ſuch Pits can be expected.</p>
                  <p>And further, theſe Bold Sureties on the Child's behalf, being asked concerning his Belief of the Articles of Faith, called the <hi>Creed,</hi> go on, and being taught of Man, are not afraid to ſay any thing, and affirm, That all that they ſtedfaſtly believe, though in their Heart the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is not.</p>
                  <p>And being further asked, <hi>Whether be will obediently keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the Days of his Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is without ſtop or lett, without asking Counſel of God at all, <hi>I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O what a thing is Man left to himſelf! What a heap of Confuſion and Contradiction is he! O what Task-maſters of <hi>Egypt</hi> are theſe Blind Guides, to bind that on others, which they will not touch with one of their Fingers; for they themſelves neither forſake the Devil, nor his Works, as is manifeſt; nor believe in God nor Chriſt ſtedfaſtly; for how ſhould they truſt God for their Souls, who dare not truſt him for their Bellies, as their Covetous Practices ſhews? And how can they be ſaid to keep God's Holy Will and Commandments all their Days, who are doing what they ſhould not do by their own Confeſſion all their Lives long.</p>
                  <p>And when the Prieſts have thus far taken God's Name in vain, and deceived themſelves, and the Parents by making them believe that they are what they are not, by this their ſorry doing, they proceed to give Charge to the God-fathers and God-mothers, (ſo called) that they bring the Child when it can ſay (for it muſt be noted that their Religion ſtands in ſaying) the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97179:172"/>in the Vulgar Tongue, that they bring it to the Biſhop to be Confirmed by him. O ſad! O ſad! that ever Men ſhould thus dare to trifle with Holy Things. For Regeneration is a Holy Thing, but is neither wrought by outward Waſhings, nor vain Mens Words, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor their Prayers, but only by Jeſus Chriſt, the great and true Baptizer, according to the working of his Heavenly Power and Spirit of Life in the Will of God, as he ſaith, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but knoweſt not whence it comes, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goes, ſo is every one that is Born of God's Spirit,</hi> John 3.8.</p>
                  <p>And to ſhut up this Buſineſs, that none may be ignorant of the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs that goes all along in this thing, and ſo ends it; they ſay, <hi>It is certain by God's Word, that Children which are Baptized, dying before they commit Actual Sin, are undoubtedly Saved.</hi> Underſtand thus Baptized, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now to this I ſay, that if People can be wrought into ſuch Darkneſs as to believe this, and to reſt ſatisfied that it is according to the Word of God, when it is a meer Invention of the Nations in the Apoſtacy, and ſo no Scripture of Truth at all for it, it's no wonder if they can get them into the Belief of leſſer Errors. And alſo it's no wonder to ſee the Poor People, thus deluded, make ſuch haſte to get their Infants to the Prieſt, when they perceive them in any danger of dying. For theſe that lay ſo much ſtreſs upon this outward Sprinkling or Baptiſm, as they call it, muſt needs have diſmal Thoughts concerning ſuch as Die without the ſame, to wit, that they are little leſs, if not altogether Damned. And as alſo may eaſily be gathered from the Words before their Burial of their Dead, which runs thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here is to be noted,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that the Office enſuing,</hi> (to wit, of their manner of their Burial of the Dead, which they call Chriſtian Burial) <hi>is not to be uſed for any that Die unbaptized,</hi> (to wit, unſprinkled by the Prieſt, as aforeſaid) <hi>or Excommunicate, or have laid violent Hands upon themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O what Darkneſs, what Deſtruction and Miſery is in all their Ways, who account not People worthy of Chriſtian Burial, who are either Excommunicate by theſe <hi>Wretched</hi> Men, and that may be for not paying a Groat or two for Repair of their Steeple houſe, or high Place! Or will not, nay, cannot for Conſcience-ſake come under their Sprinkling. But as for the Man they ſpeak of, who hath laid violent Hands upon himſelf, what if it prove one that they ſay has been made Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, yea, confirmed in it by their Office, and was never Excommunicated by them, muſt not he have Chriſtian Burial neither? O ſtrange confuſed doings! Then it ſeems the Gates of Hell may prevail againſt ſuch as are of your Faith, though they be confirmed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:97179:173"/>in it never ſo much. And by this it alſo appears, that you are ſuch Sinners as God hears not, as was ſaid before; for you prayed after your wretched Faſhion, in your ſprinkling of them, that the Old <hi>Adam</hi> might die in them, but lo here he lives, and hath laid violent Hands upon the Body; you prayed for Power over the Devil for them, but lo here the Devil hath overcome them; you prayed that thoſe Dedicated by your Miniſtry might be Everlaſtingly Rewarded with good, but lo here your Child is become a Man, and a Self-murderer, and not thought worthy of Chriſtian Burial, as you call it.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord ſees all your grievous doings, <hi>your End is come and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Everlaſting High-prieſt is at Work, Baptizing with his Holy Spirit and Fire; O! his Fan is in his Hand throughly to purge the Floor. But you Mer-made Prieſts, who have preſumed to ſpeak, and he never ſent you, you are not as his Mouth or Meſſengers, for you put no difference, neither know ye how to put difference betwixt the Precious and the Vile. You bring in the uncircumciſed and unclean, you matter not what you do, you weigh not your Doings nor Words in God's Ballance, but the Love of Money (the Root of <hi>all Evil</hi>) hath ſo blinded your Eyes, that you will ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Truth, for your Eye being Evil, your whole Body is full of Darkneſs, as Chriſt ſaith; your Skirts are diſcovered, the Books are opened, and now will the Lord give you according to your Deeds; as you have grieved and burdened his good Spirit, ſo will he burden you with his Plagues and Terrors: And though you may cry to the Rocks and the Mountains, yet nothing ſhall hide you from his Wrath, as Truth hath ſaid it is ſo. Some have been lopping at the Branches, but now Chriſt's Axe is laid again to the Root of the Evil Tree, (Glory to his Name) to cut it up Root and Branch, that the right Heavenly Root and Branch of his own planting may bring forth Fruit to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Endleſs Praiſe, who is worthy, who is over all God Bleſſed for Ever. So be it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing, after the Children are grown up to Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at leaſt to Sixteen Years of Age, or upwards, and have paſſed the Biſhops Hands, as is before-mentioned, they are invited to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which they call the other Sacrament, wherein they eat Bread and drink Wine in remembrance of Chriſt's Death, as they ſay, until he come: But here you muſt underſtand a great Myſtery of Deceit which hath crept in amongſt the People called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſince the Apoſtles time, in the Apoſtacy and great Darkneſs of Antichriſt; to wit, that though they tell of remembring Chriſt's Death till he come, yet they do not believe, nor would have any others ever to believe, that this coming of Chriſt ſhall be whilſt People are in this Body upon the Earth,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97179:173"/>but they muſt be eating Bread and drinking Wine as a Sign, and never come to ſee it fulfilled to them in the coming of the Subſtance, to wit, Chriſt in Life and Power to dwell with them, and in them, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that looked for him; as Chriſt ſaid concerning the Fruit of the Vine, that he would drink it new with his Diſciples in his Father's Kingdom. And as Chriſt taught them, amongſt other things, to pray that the Father's Kingdom might come; and is not this to be known in People whilſt here? Yea, yea, and ſo to feel Chriſt ſupping with them, and they with him; and being unto them their daily Bread, as he ſaith in the ſixth of <hi>John, I am the Bread of Life;</hi> thus, I ſay, they remain out of the Faith of Chriſt; and ſo without Faith it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Alſo here is to be noted another grand Deceit of the Enemy in this their Sacrament, ſo called, in that he makes them believe the Bread and Wine is not holy enough, and ſufficient for that Buſineſs, unleſs the Man-made Prieſt have ſaid ſome words over it, which they call Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo Conſecrated it, as they ſpeak, with his unholy Hands; unholy I call them, and that appears from their own Confeſſion, for they daily ſay they have no Health in them, by reaſon of their grievous Offences, but if they had not in words confeſſed it, yet their Lives makes it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they are of unclean Lips, and defiled Hands, which whilſt ſo, are not fit to meddle with Holy Things, no more than the Lepers under the Law, were fit in their Leproſie to enter into the Temple, or meddle with any Holy Thing: And for thoſe words they uſe unto all that Communicate Hand over Head, which ſay, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſerve thy Body and Soul unto Everlaſting Life:</hi> It is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where they had them, for I never read any ſuch in Chriſt's giving that Bread and Wine at his laſt Supper, nor in <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> afterwards ſpeaking of it, where then had they them? Surely they have either Invented them out of their own Heads, or had them out of ſome Popiſh Book, or the like: For it is certain from the Lord Jeſus they came not, ſeeing they are ſuch a Burden to the Souls of his Redeemed Ones this Day: But again theſe words, <hi>Preſerve thy Body and Soul,</hi> ſignifies, the Blind Prieſt takes it for granted, that all that he gives this Bread unto, are in a good and ſafe Condition at preſent, though the Lord knows, and they themſelves confeſs, they remain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Offenders, and have no Health in them. O what ſad work is here amongſt them! O what grievous daubing! Firſt, they tell them, that by their ſprinkling they were made ſo and ſo, as is before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and in their Biſhoping confirmed in it; and now therefore by this eating and drinking they are preſerved, though to the Grief of the Spirit of God they live in their Sins, and in the broad way of the Old
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97179:174"/>and Evil World, where the true ſprinkling of the Blood of Chriſt is not known; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If we walk in the Light, as he,</hi> to wit, God, <hi>is in the Light, them have we Fellowſhip one with another; and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6, 7. Then it muſt needs be, that ſuch as walk in Darkneſs know not Chriſt, nor the cleanſing of his Blood, for he is only the Author of Life to all that obey him; but the unclean World eat and drink Damnation to themſelves, whatſoever to the contrary they may Imagine. But whence came this Cuſtom of Conſecrating Bread and Wine, if not from thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who falſly imagine the Real Preſence, as they call it, to be after their Conſecration? For Chriſt's giving of Thanks at his laſt Supper, before his giving of Bread and Wine, is nothing to your Cuſtom. Alſo ſeeing you pretend to give all the Vertue to the Thing ſignified, and not to the Signs, you ſpoil your own Doctrine of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: But Popery is eaſilier gotten out of the Profeſſion than out of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>It would be long to tell of all the bold and ſtrange Paſſages they have in this their Communion, as in the other of their Obſervations. But this one more only may be mentioned, and ſo paſs on, and it is this, <hi>Therefore with Angels, and Archangels, and with all the Company of Heaven,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we laud and magnifie thy Glorious Name Evermore, praiſing thee, and ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hoſts, Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all People, whoſe Minds are tender towards God, I Appeal to God's Witneſs in you, whether ſuch words as theſe do any way ſuit or agree with the Condition of the Pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> who thus uſe them? For what Fellowſhip have ſuch Miſerable Offenders and Unhealed Souls with Angels, and Archangels, and all the Heavenly Company? Nay, nay, no more than Light and Darkneſs hath. But here the Whore that fits upon many Waters (which by Expoſition of the Spirit, are Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People) hath lifted up their Minds into a Conceit that they are Real Chriſtians, and ſo of the Heavenly Company, becauſe of Words, when Alas they are for the moſt part ſuch as the Apoſtle wrote unto weeping, <hi>Who ſo walk as that they are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe God is their Bellies, and glory in their ſhame, minding earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
                  <p>And what ſhall I ſay of their Ring, and plighting of their Troth, and Worſhipping one another in their Form of Wedding, when they ſay, <hi>With this Ring I thee Wed, and with my Body I thee Worſhip;</hi> but even take up a Lamentation for the People, whoſe Eye is ſo blinded by the God of this World, that they will not ſee the things that belong unto

                  <p>And as for the Viſitation of their Sick, and Churching of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they call it, (that Moſaical Rite) there is ſuch bold calling of every one, (who can but ſay a few words by rote) the Servants of God, and putters of their Truſt in God, and the like, it even burdens the Spirit of the Lord to bear it: And to hear a poor wretched Man, who hath run, and God never ſent him; to ſay, <hi>That by the Authority of God given him, he Abſolves the Sick Man from all his Sins:</hi> Such had need take heed leſt the Judgments of God fall on them, as it did upon thoſe Preſumptuous <hi>Jews,</hi> the Prieſts Sons, mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for their Burials, as they do in the reſt, ſo do they in this, and are moſt grievous Daubers and Takers of God's Name in vain; and they are not afraid to ſay indifferently of one as well as another, that they have a Hope, yea, a ſure and certain Hope of their Reſurrection to Life Eternal, though they have been never ſo Notoriouſly Evil in this Life; yea, though they have ſaid but a little before in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Curſed are the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful, Fornicators, and Adulterers, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Perſons, Idolaters, Slanderers, Drunkards and Extortioners;</hi> and both Prieft and People ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to it. And though they be found living and dying ſuch, yet now at their Burial all muſt be daubed over with a Reſurrection to Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>But here is the Device by which the Hireling lives; for what by their Doctrines and Words in their Sprinklings, in their Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their Communions, in their Burials, yea, in all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is ſuch a Bewitching of the People, and ſtrengthning the Hands of Evil-doers, that none returns from their Evil Ways, but all lyes in Death and Darkneſs, without remorſe; none ſmites upon his Thigh, and ſaith, <hi>What have I done?</hi> But with Death they make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and with Hell are they and their Multitude at Agreement; but with the Over flowing Scourge of his Wrath, will the Lord ſweep away all Lying Refuges; and the Lord is begun to make a Bleſſed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between the Precious and the Vile, Glory to his Name for Ever. So be it; ſo be it.</p>
                  <p>O! the ſet Wages and Hire in every Pariſh, ſeconded with an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law to compel it, and the many ſtinted Forms of Words and Actions in their Services made ready to their Hands, and Enjoined

But God is ſhaking his Hand againſt ſuch Diſhoneſt Gain; and the Lord hath, and is reſtoring to us the Ancient Miniſtry as in the Apoſtles Days, where all was done by the Ability of God's own Spirit, in ſuch as had freely received the Gift thereof, and therefore could and can freely give, Glory to his Name for Evermore. <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16. 2 Theſ. 5.2, 3. Prov. 1.27. Mal. 2.1.

                  <p>And if you ſtill continue in your vain Thoughts, thinking to pleaſe God with ſuch a Life, <hi>wherein you are daily doing what you ought not to do, and leaving undone what God commands you,</hi> and never come out of that wretched and miſerably defiled State; but think a cuſtomary Confeſſion of Sins, without forſaking of them, is a Worſhip worthy the pure God, <hi>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</hi> I ſay, if theſe Thoughts and this Heart continue in you,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 1.6, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord will caſt you off, and will utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake you, and bring his ſore Plagues upon you;</hi> and you ſhall know in that Day that God will not be mocked, but will be ſanctified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in his Judgments over all his Enemies, eſpecially over ſuch as you, who take his Name daily in your Mouths in vain, ſaying, Lord, Lord, and living in a continual Breach of his moſt Holy Commandments; and who inſtead of waiting for his Holy Spirit, to kindle a pure heavenly Zeal in you towards God and Chriſt,

                  <p>THE Lord Speaks this to the Ungodly People in thoſe Days, who made a Vain and Hypocritical Shew of Faſting, but the Lord Regarded them not; and the ſame Lord, the Everlaſting God, who was angry then with that Falſe-hearted People, is Angry and fore Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the like Generation of Evil and Ungodly Men at this Day; who, when any Plague or Calamity comes upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that the Hand of God cannot but be ſeen againſt them, then they will call a Faſt for a Day in a Week or a Month, or ſo, and ſo make a Shew of Humbling themſelves in the outward, but in the mean time the Sin of their Souls, and Evil of their Lives is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from, but in their Words and Deeds they are the ſame both in the ſight of God and Man after their Faſt; Yea, many of them in the very Day of their Faſt, as they were before. Were they Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards before, they continue ſo ſtill; were they given to Swearing, and taking God's Holy Name in Vain, they are found the ſame ſtill, for all their Faſting, as they were before. Were they Proud and Covetous, given to Oppreſs, Extort and Over-reach the Poor, and Over-reach their Neighbours in their Bargainings and Dealings, that they may be Rich, and ſo Live, like the Rich Glutton, in all manner of Exceſs of Meat, Drink and Cloaths, they are found the ſame; alas the very ſame, if not worſe, after the Faſt, as they were before: Or were they Guilty of laying heavy Burdens upon the Tender-Conſcienced People: yea, and of Impriſoning ſuch as in Conſcience to God could not Bow to every thing that Man's Will ſet up, Alas! to the Grief of God's Holy Spirit, they are found in the ſame Steps ſtill; and therefore ſaith the Lord from time to time, <hi>Ye ſhall not thus Faſt as ye do this Day, to cauſe your Voice to be heard on High:</hi> Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen a Day for a Man to Afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his Head like a Bull-ruſh, or ſo? Wilt thou call this a Faſt, an acceptable Day to the Lord? Nay, nay, this is not the Faſt that God hath choſen, but this is only that which vain deceived Man, in his Ignorance and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, chooſeth. For the true Faſt, even that which the Holy God in all Ages, and from all People Requireth, is that every one depart from the Evil of his Way, and from the Violence that is in his Heart
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97179:181"/>and Hands, and ſo to looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, and to undo the heavy Burdens that lye upon Soul or Body; and ſo in Deed and Truth to let the Oppreſſed go free, and to break every Yoke, and to be Merciful, Pittiful, and Tender-hearted one to another, according to Jeſus Chriſt. O! this is the Faſt that pleaſeth God, that which his Soul, and the Soul of the Righteous Loveth.</p>
                  <p>But to ſee People gather together for a few Hours of a Day, and in a few, or many Formal Words, Confeſs Sin and Wickedneſs, and yet Live in it, this is Abominable in the ſight of God and all good Men.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all Awake, Ariſe, and ſtand up to Judgment, O all ye People of the Earth, who are found in ſuch Deceitful Worſhip, for God is not Mocked, neither will he be at all Reconciled to you, until you, from the Heart, put away all your Sins, whereby his Glory this Day is ſo much ſtained, and until you bring forth Fruits of Righteouſneſs, and ſuch Words and Works daily as are worthy amendment of Life.</p>

                  <head>Something in Anſwer to ſome Paſſages in that naughty Book, called, <hi>A Looking-Glaſs for Ladies.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HE ſaith in Page 89 and 90. <hi>There are two ſorts of Love; One Legal, The other Evangelical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Firſt, which is Legal, is to Love God with all our Hearts, all our Souls, and all our Might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This,</hi> ſaith this Man, <hi>no Man can attain unto in this Life, no not the Regenerate themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, That this Man ſhews plainly, that he knows not what he ſaith, but is not only a Falſe Witneſs againſt God and his Work in his Regenerate People, but alſo a manifeſt Contradicter of himſelf, for ſaith he, <hi>Evangelical Love is when a Man begins here truly to Love God.</hi> 2. <hi>When he doth daily grow and increaſe in this Love.</hi> 3. <hi>When he is Conſtant in the ſame to the end, ſo that nothing can draw him from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:97179:181"/>
                  <p>This he and all that ſort will in words confeſs the Regenerate in this Life may do, and yet not love God with that Love the Law requires. What Contradiction is this? Is not this Love perfect and anſwerable to God's Law, when one, Firſt, Loves God truly; Secondly, Grows and Increaſes daily in this true Love; and, Thirdly, When one is ſo conſtant in the ſame, that nothing can draw the Soul from it: And therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, &amp;c. That which <hi>the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemned him in the Fleſh; that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let any who knows God, give in his Witneſs, if this Man do not deny the very End of Chriſt's Coming in the Fleſh, which was, as the Apoſtle ſaith here, to fulfil the Law in and for his People, that they might love the Lord their God in Chriſt Jeſus, with all their Heart, Soul, and Might, according to his Holy Law; as one well ſaid, That which the Law requireth, the Goſpel fulfilleth. But ſuch Men as this, who flatters the faln Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> by pleading for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Perſons, knows nothing of the Matter in themſelves, but only as they imagine from the Letter without, they tell every Man his Dream to his Neighbour, and ſo by their falſe Doctrines, and Self-contradictions, as is manifeſt here, do daily make the ſhame of their Nakedneſs appear, and their Envy to the Servants of God, whom they Reproach under the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> appears very much in ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as he there ſets down ſaying, <hi>This ſerves to reprove the</hi> Quakers <hi>who are poſſeſſed of Perfection through Satan's Pride;</hi> and adds, <hi>O that ever a poor Worm of the Earth, a very Lump of Sin and Corruption, to think that he dare look God in the Face in a ſinleſs Condition! Theſe need not a Pſalm of Mercy,</hi> ſaith the Lying Spirit in this <hi>Sam. Smith</hi> that writ that Book, <hi>theſe will not be beholding to Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, Firſt, It's Blaſphemy to ſay, That the Regenerate Man's ſinleſs Perfection is proud Satan's Work: For it is Chriſt's Bleſſed Work to perfect his Saints, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14. and Chap. 5.25, 26, 27. And Secondly, It's a falſe Slander, and unjuſt Accuſation of us, whom the World calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> to ſay, That we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay or think, that any Worm of the Earth, or Lump of Sin and Corruption, either dares, or ever poſſibly can look God in the Face, or ever attain to a ſinleſs Condition; for Earth, Sin and Corruption, cannot enter into God's Kingdom, or inherit Incorruption: But this we ſay, That the Regenerate who are Born again, even Born of God, of the Incorruptible Seed of his Heavenly Ever-living Word, are ſinleſs and perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, with whom they are one, and in him do in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97179:182"/>all Holy Humility and Acceptance with the Father, ſtand before his Throne, where no Earth, nor lumps of Sin and Corruption, nor no falſe Accuſer of the Brethren, nor Reſpecter of Perſons, can ever come.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas this Man <hi>Sam. Smith</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Evangelical Love (before deſcribed) is far ſhort of that Love the Law requireth,</hi> is a falſe Witneſs and Accuſer of Chriſt, as though he came to deſtroy or make void the Law; <hi>But do not think,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that I came to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfil:</hi> And is not this the great Thing and Sum of all the Law and the Prophets, thou ſhalt love the Lord God with all thy Soul, Mind and Strength? And doth not Chriſt the Power of God, fulfil this in his Members? Yea, yea, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid expreſly in <hi>Rom</hi> 8.4. before mentioned, <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> But now ſuch as profeſs the Letter, and want the Life, and ſo walk not after the Spirit, but the Fleſh, theſe do not love wholly, nay, not at all in Truth, and ſo with this <hi>Smith,</hi> are Breakers of the Law of God, and ſo not at all in the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>The next thing obſervable in this wretched Man's Book aforeſaid, called, <hi>The Looking-glaſs,</hi> is his grievous Oppoſition againſt the Doctrine of Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>That there is none ſo Godly, Righteous or Religious here in this Life, or can attain to that Meaſure of Grace, to be Perfect, but ſtands in need of the Exhortation, Prayers, and Godly Advice of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, That though godly Exhortation, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Advice amongſt Brethren of Chriſt be lovely, yet for him to ſay, There is none ſo perfect, but ſtands in an abſolute Neceſſity of theſe from Man, is not true; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking not to the Teachers only, but to the Brethren of Chriſt in general, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>Theſe Things I have written to you concerning them that ſeduce you, but the anointing which ye have of God the Holy One, teacheth you all things, and you need not that any Man teach you, but as that teacheth you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and you know all things: And theſe things,</hi> ſaith another Apoſtle to the Brethren, <hi>do I write unto you by way of remembrance,</hi> (not abſolute Neceſſity, as this Man ſpeaks) to ſtir up your pure Minds. And this Doctrine of the Hirelings, is only to keep up their Maſterly Power over the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Conſciences; and indeed denies the Gift of God's Spirit, and coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, and the very End of his Miniſtry, which was for the perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cting of the Saints, even in this Life. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. at large. But the Hirelings Doctrine, which perfects nothing but Sin, keeps People always learning, laden with divers Sins and Luſts, but never brings them to the Knowledge of the Truth, which ſets free from
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97179:182"/>Sin; and therefore from ſuch, according to Chriſt's Doctrine, ought all People to turn away.</p>
                  <p>But what, muſt this <hi>Sam. Smith,</hi> and his Fellows, who would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Maſters of Aſſemblies, be taught of others? Indeed they ſtand in need of teaching; for they have run, and God never ſent them, and therefore they cannot profit the People at all, as is here manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this <hi>Smith</hi> for denying Perfection, ſaith he, is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Beſt of God's Saints and Servants in this Life are not capable of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And is any Child,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>put by his Maſter into the higheſt Form the first day he comes to School? Or doth he not lead him on by degrees? The Apoſtles themſelves, that had the Spirit, and ſo in a Capacity of more plentiful Revelation than we are, yet Chriſt tells them, he had many things to tell them, but they could not bear them then.</hi> And for this he brings <hi>John</hi> 16.12.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That this Man here doth manifeſtly abuſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by that the Nature of his Naughty Spirit in all his Diſcourſe is eaſily ſeen. For here he ſaith, they had the Spirit, and yet could not bear Chriſt's words, whereas Chriſt in that place makes the want of the coming of the Spirit, the very Cauſe why they could not then bear his words; and therefore he ſaith in the very next words, in that of <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth, and ſhew you things to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo this <hi>Smith</hi> is one of them that abuſes and wreſts Scripture, tending to his own and others Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But whereas he ſaith, That the Apoſtles who had the Spirit, were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a more plentiful Revelation than they are, that's true; for they, to wit, ſuch Hirelings and Wreſters of Scripture, as this <hi>Smith</hi> is, are Senſual, not having the Spirit, and ſo are far from receiving any Viſion or Revelation from God, ſeeing it's their common Doctrine to deny Immediate Teachings and Revelations from God, for that's ceaſed, ſay they.</p>
                  <p>But for him to ſay, as theſe his words would inſinuate, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in thoſe Days were capable of more plentiful Revelation than any are in theſe Days, is falſe; for God is the ſame to his now as then; and ſuch as are Faithful in a little now, ſhall be Ruler over much, as well as formerly; and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I pray not for theſe only, but for all that ſhall believe on me through their words, that they may be one, as we are One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for his Reaſon or Proof, That the Beſt of the Beſt of the Saints and Servants of God in this Life, are not capable of Perfection, the very Child, or School-boy he ſpeaks of, may come forth and conſute it: For what though a Scholar be not perfect in his Book at firſt, doth it

He may as well ſay ſo as the other, for his Compariſon doth utterly make void his falſe Doctrine againſt Perfection, as Experience of all Men, both Maſters and Scholars, proves. But what a Mountain of Enmity is riſen up in theſe Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teachers of theſe Times, (who love to be called of Men Maſter) againſt that Heavenly Doctrine of ſinleſs Perfection, is manifeſt to all in this, that though they can allow of a Perfection in all Arts and Sciences in their kinds, yea, and of a Perfection in the growth of all other Creatures in this kind, but cannot endure to hear tell of, much leſs to allow of a Perfection in the Children of the Everlaſting Father, God over all, who is this Day well witneſſed upon his Throne, Ever Praiſed be his Name, bringing forth his Heavenly Birth, and Babes, and ſo making all things new. But who ever, but this Slanderous Spirit in this <hi>Smith,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That though People have lived in Drunkenneſs, Swearing, and open Prophaneneſs many Years, yet if but once come to be lifted</hi> (as he ſcornfully calls it) <hi>into that Society,</hi> (to wit, of ſuch as he and the reſt of the World in Scorn call <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>that preſently they are perfect, and without Sin?</hi> And then like the troubled Sea he foams out his own Shame, and adds, ſaying in that forementioned Book,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Challenge all the</hi> Quakers <hi>on Earth, and in Hell, to give a ſober an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe Texts of Scripture,</hi> Eccleſ 7.2. 1 Kings 8.46. Prov. 20.9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By theſe words of this Enemy of God, and his Perfect Work in his Saints, any who judge in the Light of God in the leaſt meaſure, may ſee the Rancour and Malicious Blind Nature of that Spirit by which he was acted; O! that ever Men ſhould take upon them to be Miniſters of the Goſpel (as ſuch would be accounted) and yet utter ſuch baſe words: Did ever any Enemy of Truth, from the beginning of the World to this Day, make ſuch a Challenge? What! muſt People come out of Hell to give thee a Sober Anſwer? What! hath Paſſion and Envy ſo blinded thy Heart, as to imagine that the Inhabitants of Hell can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Queſtions, and that in ſoberneſs; nay, nay, they muſt be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly People that give truly ſober Anſwers in ſuch weighty Matters as theſe; and therefore thy unſober, wild words in theſe Matters, ſhews where thy Dwelling is, to wit, not in Heaven amongſt the Saints and Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, but in the Earthly, Senſual and Deviliſh Wiſdom, amongſt thoſe who are Enemies to Truth and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo Miniſters of Antichriſt, who plead for Sin during tearm of Life, and not of Chriſt, who came for that very end to perfect his Saints, and to preſent them himſelf even in this Life, without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo the Reproachful and Malicious words of this <hi>Sam. Smith</hi> againſt the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Holy Doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:97179:183"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97179:184"/>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:97179:184"/>Perfection put aſide, I ſay concerning thoſe Scriptures he mentions, and firſt to that <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>For there is not a Juſt Man upon Earth, that doeth good, and ſinneth not;</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks of Men under the Law, and of the Generation of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, amongſt whom there is not indeed a Juſt Man that doeth good and ſinneth not; but this doth not make void the Covenant of God with his Elect, in Chriſt Jeſus the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven; for as is the Heavenly, ſo are they that are Heavenly. And ſo whoſoever is Born of God, and abideth in Chriſt, ſinneth not; for he that ſinneth hath neither ſeen Chriſt, nor known Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6, 9. And herein is that ſaying true, 1 <hi>John</hi> laſt, <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned,</hi> (to wit, in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or Fleſh) <hi>we make God a Liar;</hi> but now being Tranſlated out of that Kingdom of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of the Dear Son of God, the Light; we put on Chriſt's Nature, which is Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, without which none ſhall ſee God; Bleſſed be God for his Unſpeakable Rich Gift.</p>
                  <p>And ſo though in the Firſt Man's faln Nature there is Sin and Death, yet in Chriſt Jeſus there is Life, Righteouſneſs, and Everlaſting Peace: And if thou wouldſt not have Death, the Wages of Sin, thou muſt come out of the Fleſh into the Spirit of Chriſt, where Life and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Peace is witneſſed. This is the Day of the Lord's Mighty Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he is ſeparating the Sheep from the Goats, and making the difference plain and manifeſt betwixt ſuch as ſerve God, and ſuch as ſerve Sin.</p>
                  <p>And for that other Scripture, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. which ſaith, <hi>There is no Man that ſinneth not,</hi> it muſt in like manner be underſtood as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to wit, of Man in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or faln Fleſhly Nature, where all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God; and in which ſtate of Sin and Unbelief whoſoever abide, they do ſin daily: But this toucheth not at all the ſinleſs and perfect ſtate of the Children of God in Chriſt Jeſus, where Sin, which is the Devil's Work, comes not, as was ſaid before; for the Prince of this World hath no part in me, ſaith Chriſt: And therefore who art thou that lays Sin to the Charge of God's Elect? Thy own words ſhall be thy Burden, but Peace on God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> for Evermore.</p>
                  <p>And for that third Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> I ſay, No Man can ſay that he hath made himſelf ſo, though in Chriſt Jeſus he is ſo; for not of our ſelves, but of God's alone Mercy and Free-gift in Chriſt Jeſus, it comes to paſs that the Elect Veſſels are cleanſed and made pure in Heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that well-known place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27 <hi>Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97179:185"/>Water, by the Word, that he might preſent it himſelf a Glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not here a Company made clean indeed, yea, clean at Heart, and pure from Sin in and by Chriſt Jeſus: Therefore let all the Enemies of Chriſt, and his perfect Work, be ſilent for ever. So be it.</p>
                  <p>But above all, it ſeems ſtrange what he ſets down in that Defiling Book called <hi>The Looking-glaſs,</hi> where he ſaith, That <hi>Philpot, Bradford</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> confeſſed, <hi>That they were vile ſinful and wretched Hypocrites, even at the State when to be burnt for their Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, either he, or the Printer or Relator of the Hiſtory, or all of them, do greatly wrong them Sufferers, or elſe their Condition is greatly to be lamented, who had ſo much Zeal and Boldneſs as to Suffer for the ſake of their Conſcience, and yet had ſo little Knowledge and Underſtanding of the Myſtery of God and Chriſt, as not to know the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt no better.</p>
                  <p>But we leave this, and ſo proceed to ſee what there is in thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which he ſaith the Quakers make ſo much uſe of, to prove Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the Perfect Man, and behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for the end of that Man is Peace.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> The third is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Howbeit we ſpeak Wiſdom among them that are perfect.</hi> The fourth is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Finally Brethren farewel, be perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which I ſay, It's moſt plain to every pure Eye, that theſe Scriptures, with many more that might be brought to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, prove ſufficiently a Sinleſs Perfection, otherwiſe it is no Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all if not Sinleſs of God's working, for every Work of God is Sinleſs and Perfect; for that Perfection which is in or with Sin, is the Work of the Man of Sin, and is that Perfection which pleaſeth his vile ſinful hypocritical Members ſo well. And ſo whoſoever marks and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds this imperfect and unbelieving Generation, ſhall plainly ſee their End is Trouble and Miſery; and therefore it is that our words which we ſpeak this day from the Lord, concerning the great things of his Kingdom, are accounted no better than Folly and Error amongſt theſe ſinful Oppoſers of God's Work of Sinleſs Perfection in his Saints; and ſo theſe Oppoſers are never going on to God's Perfection, but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from that of God in them, which ſhould lead them to God, and ſo their Back and not their Face turned to God, they are ever learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus, which perfects to God all that come to it: And ſo how
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97179:185"/>can they for ſhame exhort their Hearers to Perfection, who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the great Oppoſers of God's perfect Work in his People, above all others.</p>
                  <div type="conclusion">
                     <head>To conclude.</head>
                     <p>That which remains at preſent to be ſpoken to that filthy <hi>Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> is to wipe off a heap of Lies and Dirt, which he hath falſly charged upon the Innocent and Harmleſs People of God called <hi>Quakers;</hi> as in p. 249. where he ſaith,</p>
                     <p>That <hi>we diſown the Ordinances of Chriſt and his Goſpel, the Word preached by his Miniſters, Church-order, Baptiſm, and Supper of the Lord, Prayer, Singing of Pſalms, the Publick Miniſtry, as no Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt. Albeit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God hath ſet his Seal thereto in the Converſion of many Souls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To all which in a word I anſwer and ſay, The Lord both hath and yet will rebuke that Lying Spirit by which this Book was written.</p>
                     <p>And in particular to the ſeveral parts of this falſe and notorious lying Charge againſt us, I ſay, That the Ordinances of Chriſt, and his everlaſting Goſpel, we dearly love and own, and the Word preached by his Miniſters, but not the Miniſters of Antichriſt, we dearly own and delight in; for the Word of God which the Miniſters of Chriſt, which he ſends, preach, is Spirit and Life, not the dead Letter, for the dead Letter which the Hirelings preach for filthy Lucre, we know to be no better than Chaff, compared with that living Word which the Miniſters of Chriſt preach, for the Letter of the Hireling killeth, but the Spiritual Word of the Goſpel of Chriſt gives Life; the Word of the Lord in the Mouth of Chriſt's Miniſters which we own, is the Savour of Life to Life, and of Death to Death. But ſo is not the falſe frothy Doctrine of the Hireling and falſe Accuſer, ſuch as this <hi>Sam. Smith,</hi> who wrote this Book which we diſown is nothing worth, and therefore cannot profit the People at all: And therefore he tells a great Lye, in ſaying, <hi>That God hath ſet his Seal to the Miniſtry of ſuch as have run and God never ſent them;</hi> as is manifeſt by this Man, who is not aſhamed to ſpeak all manner of Evil falſly againſt whom the Lord hath Bleſſed for his Name's ſake; for thoſe whom God ſends, are one with, and not againſt, ſuch as are of God. But becauſe he neither knows the Father, nor Chriſt, therefore he thinks he doth well, to perſecute and revile us with all ſlanderous words, which will be his own Burden in God's Judgment-day.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Church. Order,</hi> it's manifeſt by the Walking of our Members who owns it moſt, for they who walk moſt orderly in Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,

                     <p>And for the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> we cannot but love and own it with our very Souls, for it is our Souls Food, and the Lord is known to us, and in us, daily, by breaking of his Heavenly Bread in the midſt of us, as he ſaid, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any Man open to me, I will come in and Sup with him, and he with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, both Publick and Private, thoſe that ſay we diſown this, do plainly manifeſt that they know little of us or our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, but are ſhameleſs Forgers of Lies againſt the Innocent; for which, and for all their Sins, God will judge them, it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>But for Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> what hath this falſe Accuſer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to do with Singing? For not Singing, but Mourning, is the ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Exerciſe for the Wicked, What will ye yet Sing and Rejoyce and make Merry over the Witneſſes of God which ye have ſlain in your.

Nay, theſe cannot; for, what is their Chaff to the Wheat, their frothy Words to the powerful Word of God? For, ſow a Field with Chaff, and what a Crop can you expect? But as the Prophet ſaith. <hi>They ſow the Wind, and reap the Whirlwind:</hi> So ceaſe from them, you that love God and your own Souls, and turn to God; for I Teſtifie for God, That the True Miniſtry, the Soul-ſaving Miniſtry of Chriſt Jeſus, is not with the Pariſh-Hirelings of theſe Days; for neither their long Black Robes, nor long White Surplices, nor their Humane Learning, nor the Ordination of Man, Men of like Nature with themſelves, doth any more conduce to the making of them able Miniſters of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Everlaſting Covenant of God, than the Grey or Brown Coat of the Plow-man, or Artificer, or the Skill of the Husbandman in Husbandry; or the Cunning of the Cunning Worker in Wood, Braſs, or Iron, doth furniſh them for Goſpel-ſervice; for the Viſion of God's Kingdom to all the World this Day, both Wiſe and Fooliſh, is like a Book ſealed, as the Prophet ſaith, which is given to the Worldly-wiſe to read, and he cannot read it, becauſe it's ſeal'd; and to the Fooliſh, and he cannot read it, becauſe he is unlearned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. ſo though in the World there is a difference betwixt the Wiſe and Fooliſh, yet as to the Kingdom of God there is none; for <hi>the Wiſdom of this World is fooliſhneſs with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that which lyeth hid from all Fleſh, God reveals to his by his Spirit; for <hi>the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6, 7, 8.

                     <p>And ye People of <hi>Stafford,</hi> for your ſakes it was that the Lord by my Mouth rebuked the <hi>Hireling,</hi> that you might not always be deceived, and kept in Death with ſuch Dreamers; but that you might turn to the Lord God, from all ſuch, to know his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that made you, in you, to teach you, and to lead your Immortal Souls to the Springs of Living Waters; for you have too long dwelt in the <hi>Wilderneſs of Sin, Ignorance, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and now it is high time for you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and come to know the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and Fire, which is Chriſt's proper Baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. for, alas! you have but hitherto been carried on by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the outward Shadows and Figures of Things, which reach not the Soul, to purifie and perfect it unto God, and therefore is the Lord come in Mighty Power this Day, to break in ſunder all the Graven Images of the People, whether under the Profeſſion of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; for the Lord is on his Throne, to make all things new again, as in the beginning, when all the Sons of God in Holineſs ſung for Joy, and rejoiced in the Lord, for the Bleſſed Victory they had got through the Blood of the Lamb over all their Souls Enemies.</p>

                     <p>So all People fear the Lord God; for the Name of Chriſtians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nature of Chriſt, will do you no good at all; for the Lord is come to ſearch all that called Chriſtendom with Candles, and to pull down the lofty Hearts and Looks of all amongſt them called Chriſtians firſt, and then of all the World beſides; for now is the Lord exalting his great Name over all, as in the Beginning, before the Antichriſt, Beaſt, Falſe Prophet and Whore got up; and who ſhall ſtop the Paſſage of this mighty <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in the great Work of ſetting up his Kingdom over all the Kingdoms of the Man of Sin, that the Kingdoms of this World, may become the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Right alone it is to Rule and Reign, according to that Saying in the Prophet, <hi>I will Overturn, Overturn, Overturn, till he come to Rule whoſe Right it is.</hi>

But ſaith he again, <hi>It is not enough to believe all that is written in the Bible, but we muſt believe alſo Apoſtolical Traditions,</hi> citing 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. Now ſay I in anſwer hereto, That through wreſting and abuſing of this Scripture, have they made way for bringing in all their Filthy Popiſh Stuff, whereby Thouſands, and Ten thouſands, of poor Peoples Souls, both have been, and are at this day miſerably deluded; for certainly the Traditions which the Apoſtle there tells of, whether by Word or Epiſtle, where all of one nature, and not directly contrary or contradictory one to another: But the Popiſh Traditions, though they may falſly call them Apoſtolical, are directly contrary to Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith he, <hi>The Apoſtles Creed is not in the Scripture, and yet is to be believed.</hi>

                     <p>To which I anſwer, If the Apoſtles <hi>Creed</hi> (ſo called) either be not in Scripture in ſo many words, or do not wholly agree with it in nature, we are not to believe it: But the reaſon why we believe it, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope ſaith it is Apoſtolical, but becauſe rightly Expounded or underſtood (but not with the Popiſh or other wrong Expoſition) we find it, for Subſtance, agreeable to Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith he, <hi>If a Man ſhall deny, or obſtinately doubt of one Point of Faith, Would he thereby loſe his whole Faith? Yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe true Faith muſt always be entire; and be that faileth in one, is made guilty of all, by diſcrediting the Authority of God revealing it.</hi> Then ſay I, Neither to Pope, nor General Councils, need People be beholden for their Faith, but to God only, according to Chriſt's words, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>They ſhall all be taught of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now mark People, under theſe ſeeming words of this Sophiſter, what a World of Wickedneſs lyeth hid: For though he uſe the words <hi>(of God's revealing Faith)</hi> for a Cloak, yet he intendeth nothing ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: For if I, or another Man, ſhould come and truly ſay, God hath revealed this and the other thing to be his Will, I ſhould believe, and that by his Spirit I am able to make it manifeſt, that it agrees with the Scripture of Truth; yet if the Pope and his Councils do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, it ſhall be no Faith with them; but I ſhall be accounted an Heretick, and fit to be Burned, where they get Power, as hath been manifoldly proved in <hi>England</hi> and other places. And again, this Wickedneſs lyes hid under his words, That if a Meſſenger of the Pope, as Jeſuit or other Prieſt or Teacher of them, ſay to the poor People, that do in general too much believe their Falſe Doctrines and Practices, yet if they do not in particular believe all their Superſtitions, then they have loſt all their Faith, and ſo conſequently are Damned.

Doctrines and Catholick Practices, (tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to relate) If they do not believe all, then by this Man's Doctrine they have loſt all their Faith: And why? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Pope and his Councils</hi> (which they account God's revealing, for no other God they look at to teach them, as afterwards in this his Book appears) <hi>have ſaid it muſt be ſo.</hi> O the miſerable Slavery of all ſuch as are under this Helliſh Egyptian Yoke!

                     <p>And for his Worſhipping and Praying unto Angels, as alſo Saints, which here and elſewhere he mentions, and brings ſome Scripture wreſted, as their Cuſtom is, ſeemingly to prove it: That one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſay, inſtead of many others, which might be brought, ſhall ſerve for ever to daſh in pieces the Head of that Venomous and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Doctrine and Practice of Bowing and Praying unto Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, where it is ſaid, <hi>That to God in Chriſt, every Knee in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth muſt bow, and every Tongue confeſs. And when he brings in his only begotten into the World, he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him:</hi> And therefore the Angel in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8, 9. utterly denied <hi>John</hi>'s worſhipping him, ſaying, <hi>Worſhip God.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. The whole Company both of Saints and Angels fell down according to their Duty and great Engagement, and did worſhip God. So that if the Saints and Angels were as ready, and as well pleaſed, to receive Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as theſe Superſtitious Men are to give it them, they would loſe their Holy Place, and be like them; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not that Honour which comes from God only?</hi> John 5.44. But truly Holy Saints and Angels are better learned than ſo, and therefore abhor all Honour, but that which comes from God only, and for that they return to him alone as his due, all Honour, Glory and Praiſe; ſaying, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4 laſt, <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive Glory, Honour and Power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> And ſo true Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veny Brethren, and Fellow-Servants and Keepers of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, as all true Saints and Angels, whether in Heaven or Earth, are, look not for Worſhip one from another, but gives all to God their Maker and Saviour to whom it's due: But it's the Devil that would have God's Honour from him to himſelf, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.9, 10. but none but the Wicked will give it him.</p>
                     <p>And then, if the Saints and Angels themſelves be not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, much leſs their Pictures: Alſo I ſay, If ſuch living Images of God and Chriſt, as Holy Saints and Angels are, are not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, much leſs dead Images of God and Chriſt, invented by Man's Brain, and framed by Man's hand, are to be adored, but to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, as <hi>Nehuſtan</hi> that little piece of Braſs was, which the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Idolized.</p>
                     <p>And this Popiſh Book, ſpeaking of the Neceſſity of the Incarnation, ſaith, <hi>If it had not been, ſcarce one of a Thouſand</hi> (and thoſe great Clerks only) <hi>would have known God to any Saving Purpoſe or ſo, becauſe of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sublimity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this it appears, how perfectly this great Clerk is ignorant of Truth; and in this, how diametrically oppoſite to the Apoſtle's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97179:191"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> firſt and ſecond Chapters; for there he makes the World's Wiſdom in general, Fooliſhneſs with God; and in particular, the wiſeſt ſort of them fartheſt from the Saving Knowledge of God: And ſo attributes all Saving Knowledge to the alone Revelation of the Spirit of God, and that to Babes and Sucklings, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. But this Sophiſter imagines, great Clerks can do ſomething more than others in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it were well if all Proteſtants were well purged of this bad Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In his Fourth Article of the Greed he asks, <hi>Is it lawful to honour the Croſs? Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with a relative Honour: Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Memorial of the Paſſion, and is called, the Sign of the Son of Man,</hi> Matt. 24 20. he would ſay, it's like, Verſe 30.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſay, It's a meer Dream and Falſhood, to call an outward Croſs the Sign of the Son of Man, for in that Scripture there is not the leaſt Intimation of a Croſs, for the words are theſe, <hi>Then</hi> (to wit, as in the former Verſe, when <hi>the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken</hi>) <hi>ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the ſign of the Son of Man in Heaven: And then ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory.</hi> The Diſciples, in the beginning of this Chapter, asked him, What ſhould be the Sign of his Coming? And here he anſwers them, (Not a wooden Croſs, or any ſuch thing, but) the fore-goings of Judgment, terrible Judgments, as is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which go immediately before this his appearing. And for the outward Croſs, being a ſpecial Memorial of the Paſſion, The Apoſtles had other ways of remembring Chriſt's Death, than by outward Croſſes of Wood, Gold, Silver, or other Metal or Stone, or ſo, for they were buried with him into the likeneſs of his Death; and they bore in their Bodies the Marks and Dying of the Lord Jeſus, and the Vertue of Chriſt's Paſſion, they felt daily to Crucifie them to the World, and the World, with all its Evil, to them: And as they died, and were dead to Sin, they were made alive, and lived to God; and ſo Chriſt lived in them, and they in him, How could they forget one another? And thus it was not only with the Apoſtles, but with all the true and living Members of Jeſus, ſtanding thus in the Faith in thoſe Times, as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plentifully declares; and neither need, nor mention made, of any outward Croſs, to put them in mind of Chriſt's Paſſion, ſeeing they daily ſuffered and reigned with him. But People retaining only the Name of Chriſtians, but falling from the Faith of Chriſt, which the true Saints lived in, then came up this Invention of outward Croſſes and Pictures, and ſuch-like Smoak out of the Bottomleſs Pit, for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and Teachers to the poor Carnal-minded People which were out of the Faith, and ſo at Enmity againſt God: But Praiſes to the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97179:191"/>Lord, ſaith my Soul, for this day of his, which after a long Night of Darkneſs, is reſtoring to many the ancient everlaſting Truth, which all Holy Men of God lived by: And now Myſtery <hi>Babylon;</hi> with all her Lovers, muſt into the Lake prepared for her.</p>
                     <p>But ſays this Dreamer farther, <hi>The Croſs was that bleſſed Altar on which Chriſt offered his Bloody Sacrifice:</hi> And to prove it brings <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. In which laſt Scripture he ſays, <hi>Such as were ſigned with the ſign</hi> Tau (which was a Picture or Figure of the Croſs) <hi>were ſaved from the exterminating Angel, and only ſuch.</hi> Now to this I ſay, it is meer Deceit: And adding to the Scripture this Saying of his, for there is mention made only of a Mark Viſion-wiſe, but nothing at all what Mark it was, neither was it needful, for to mark them there, ſignifies God's ſpecial Care of his in time of Judgment, and not an outward Croſs, as theſe Dreamers Dream. And for thoſe other Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. they ſpeak not of the outward Croſs of Wood or ſo, but of the inward Spiritual Croſs, the Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17, 18. But this Man, by calling the Croſs the Altar, maketh it greater than Chriſt; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Whether is greater, the Gift, than the Altar that Sanctifies it?</hi> And thus it appears, how near unto Blaſphemy are all Superſtitious and Idolatrous Minds.</p>
                     <p>In his Expoſition of the Fifth Article of the Creed, he ſaith, <hi>That his deſcending into Hell meaneth, That ſo ſoon as Chriſt was dead, his bleſſed Soul deſcended into Limbo, to free the Holy Fathers who were there.</hi> And for proof brings <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, 24, 27. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. And then asks, <hi>Did he not alſo deſcend to Purgatory, to free ſuch as were there?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>It is moſt probable he did;</hi> according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That theſe dark Imaginations are poor Grounds for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to place Faith, and ſo Salvation on. <hi>It is probable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that he deſcended to Purgatory: And what, is it more than probable that he went into Limbo?</hi> Nay, nay, it is not ſo much as probable that he went into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for thoſe Scriptures he brings, ſpeaks neither of <hi>Limbo</hi> nor Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; and ſo there being no ſuch Place as either <hi>Limbo</hi> or Purgatory, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> Dream, how could he deſcend into either? For the true Place of Purging, is through Sanctification of the Spirit in the Belief of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, in this Life time, and not afterwards: And the Heil which Chriſt's Soul was not left in, is underſtood, when he ſaid, <hi>My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And for his Body, it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the Grave, and ſo the true Chriſt ſaw no Corruption, as the Scripture there ſpeaks: But your imagined Breaden Chriſt will Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
                     <p>But for this Man's Dream of Interpreting the Priſon to be Purgatory, which Chriſt by his Spirit went to Preach to them in, in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97179:192"/>that were Diſobedient, and that not till after he was Crucified, is ſo groſs, that it needs little other Confutation than the very mentioning of it; for Chriſt by his Spirit in <hi>Noah</hi> Preached to them in that Day, when they were in the Priſon of their Sins; and by the Spirit that raiſed Jeſus from the Dead, have the Wicked been Warned and Preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaith, <hi>That the print of Chriſt's Feet are to be ſeen to this Day upon</hi> Mount Olivet, <hi>from whence he was taken up:</hi> I ſay, what if it were, will you go to Worſhip it, as you do a Wood or Stone Croſs? But I do no more believe that there are ſuch prints, than I do your other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Superſtitious Imaginations and Inventions. But to Diſcredit this, I have very great ground, conſidering that Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe ſhould not touch him (in an outward natural manner, or ſo) becauſe he was not yet aſcended, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. becauſe there is danger in ſuch things, how much leſs would he leave prints of outward Feet for Superſtitious Souls to Idolize? And it's probable, for this very Cauſe was the Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> hid from the <hi>Jews,</hi> leſt they ſhould Idolize it. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> a Spiritual minded Man, for himſelf and his Brethren, <hi>Henceforth know we no Man after the Fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh, yet know we him henceforth ſo no more; for he that is in Chriſt is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16, 17. When will <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> ſo called, learn this Leſſon?</p>
                     <p>And this Book ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt, as God, is equal with the Father, but as Man, is in the higheſt Created Glory.</hi> I anſwer, the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt ſitteth, or <hi>ſat down at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high, Heb.</hi> 1.3. Is this Created?</p>
                     <p>And he asks, <hi>Is there any Merit in our Works? Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as in Apoc.</hi> 22.12. I ſay, that Scripture doth not ſay, for the Merit of Man's Work, but only they ſhall receive according as their Work is: But pure good Works are rather God's than ours, and then where is the Merit?</p>
                     <p>And he ſaith, <hi>The Place of the general Judgment ſhall be in the Valley of</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>betwixt</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Mount Oliver. I anſwer, how knows he that? How is it he mentions no Scripture for it? So it is meer Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: But what! Muſt People loſe their whole Faith, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not, as before?</p>
                     <p>In the Ninth Article, ſpeaking of the Church, he ſaith, <hi>The Church is the Congregation of all the Faithful, under Chriſt their Inviſible Head, and his Vicar upon Earth, the Pope.</hi> But how proves he this? Neither by Scripture, nor Apoſtolical Tradition, for which he brings neither, for there is none for certain; for the Church hath not two Heads, the Church is not a Monſter with two Heads, one Viſible, to wit, The
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97179:192"/>Pope, or ſuch-like; and another inviſible, to wit, Chriſt: Neither is the Church an Adultereſs with two Husbands, one viſible and another inviſible: For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, even Chriſt.</hi> So all others are Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>And then this wicked Book farther asks, <hi>What are the Eſſential parts of the Church?</hi> And to that it anſwers, <hi>A Pope or Supreme Head, Biſhops, Paſtors, and the Laity.</hi> To this I ſay, It is rank Popiſh Poiſon: And what Scripture have they for this? Surely none, nor Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition-neither, for the Apoſtles could not contradict their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the Scriptures of Truth, as is ſaid before; And the Scripture doth no where make the Church of Chriſt conſiſt of ſuch Eſſentials, for God's Church are his <hi>Cleroi,</hi> that is, his choice ones, his Lot, his Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, his Flock all of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. God's Flock are every one of them ſound, Sheep and Lambs, and they are Men, God's <hi>Cleroi,</hi> that is, <hi>Clergy,</hi> and not <hi>Laity;</hi> and the word <hi>Laity</hi> is Popiſh and Antichriſtian, as well as the Pope. And for the true Overſeers and Paſtors, Feeders in and of the true Church, What have you to do with them? unleſs it be to Perſecute them, as your Cuſtom hath been all along, ever ſince Night and Darkneſs came upon you for your great Apoſtaſie.</p>
                     <p>Then this blind Guide goes on asking, <hi>How prove you St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and the Pope his Succeſſor, to be the viſible Head of the Church?</hi> He anſwers, Firſt, out of <hi>John</hi> 21.16, 17, 18. <hi>Where Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for a Reward of his ſpecial Faith and Love, gave</hi> Peter <hi>abſolute Power to feed and govern his whole Flock, yea, even the Apoſtles themſelves to be his Sheep, and he their Head and Paſtor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, This is a moſt ſhameleſs Lie: For Chriſt was ſo far, in thoſe words, from giving <hi>Peter</hi> charge of Feeding and Governing his whole Church in general, much leſs the Apoſtles in particular, who were his Equals, that the ſame Charge that is given here, is alſo given to the reſt of the Apoſtles, though not in the ſame expreſs words as here, yet in words of the ſame import fully; as not only when he firſt called them to be Fellow Apoſtles, but alſo, and that moſt plainly, when he departed from them, as in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. where it is ſaid, <hi>And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them</hi> (that is to ſay, to the Eleven, for <hi>Judas</hi> was gone to his place) <hi>ſaying, All power in Heaven and Earth is given to me. Go ye therefore</hi> (not <hi>Peter</hi> only, but all the reſt as well as he) <hi>and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in</hi> (or rather <hi>into,</hi> as the Greek there truly ſignifies) <hi>the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo, I am with you</hi> (to wit, all of you, not <hi>Peter</hi> only) <hi>alway, even to the end of the World. Amen.</hi>

                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:97179:193"/>
                     <p>And whereas this Liar ſays, <hi>It was for</hi> Peter<hi>'s ſpecial Faith and Love;</hi> I ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> had no Faith nor Love, but what was common to all the reſt of the Apoſtles. But if all things may be reckoned, he had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Faith nor Love neither, when he denied his Maſter. And though Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> He was taught by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer forwardneſs not to ſay, Yea, I love thee more than they all, but humbly in the ſence of his former weakneſs, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> And great cauſe had he to love Chriſt greatly, ſeeing he had Diſhonoured Chriſt, and Wounded his own Soul, by Denying and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing Chriſt more than they all. And ſo no Merit in <hi>Peter</hi> for any thing can be looked at, but God's great and free Mercy, in not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving him, but alſo in imploying him in his Service again. So let your unclean Mouths be ſtopt for Ever, ye Idolizers of Creatures: For as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſo may I ſay to you, and all the World, who are ſtriving about Men, What is <hi>Paul?</hi> Or what is <hi>Apollos?</hi> So what is <hi>Peter,</hi> or others that God made uſe then, or makes uſe of now, as Inſtruments in his Hand for Peoples good, but even as nothing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt is all, and in all? And with him there conclude, <hi>Neither is he that planteth nor watereth any thing, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Chap. 3.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His other Proof for <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, is out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church; therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the reſt of the Apoſtles were built on him; and hence it is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as often as they are mentioned in Scripture he is named firſt.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay, It is no leſs than Blaſphemy to ſay, That either the Apoſtles, or the reſt of the Faithful, were Built upon <hi>Peter</hi> as a Man; for it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts all Scripture, which every where give the Glory of being the Rock, the Foundation, yea, and Corner-ſtone of the whole Building of the Church of God, to Chriſt alone, and not to <hi>Peter</hi> at all as a Man; for what is ſaid here of <hi>Peter,</hi> hath relation only and altogether to the Faith of Chriſt the Rock, here confeſſed only unto by <hi>Peter,</hi> but given of the Father. And <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſays expreſly, that the reſt of the Faithful in thoſe Days had obtained like Precious Faith with him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. And the Apoſtle blames them greatly in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. before-mentioned, for ſaying, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, that is <hi>Peter, and I of Chriſt,</hi> as though Chriſt were divided: For they all ſhould have kept the one Head Chriſt, without mentioning any Man's Name in this Matter. For as <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaid in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. There is no other Name, but that of Chriſt Jeſus, by which Men can be ſaved; then ſay I, of Neceſſity there can be no other Rock.</p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:97179:193"/>
                     <p>And whereas this Imaginer would make ſomething for <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, from his being named firſt often in Scripture, when the Apoſtles are mentioned; I ſay, though it were always as he ſays, it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for his purpoſe, but is a meer childiſh empty Conceit, not worthy a Man, much leſs one profeſſing Religion, to talk on, for ſome of them muſt be mentioned firſt; but that thus mentioning <hi>Peter</hi> in Scripture, had any ſuch Intention in it as he here Dreams of I, and not only I, but all Saints with me, do utterly deny. And as for the word Supremacy, it is inconſiſtent with the Nature of true Chriſtianity; for ſaith Chriſt to his Followers, when they were telling of who ſhould be greateſt of them, he Convinced them of their Error, by ſetting before them a little Child, and ſaying, who will be greateſt of all muſt be Servant of all, and leaſt of all; and that not in Words only, but in Deed and Truth ſay I.</p>
                     <p>But what is any thing that is ſaid of <hi>Peter</hi> in the Scripture to the Pope? <hi>O yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he is his Succeſſor.</hi> To which I ſay, it is as falſe as any thing is true; for <hi>Peter</hi> was a Holy Man of God, of Chriſt's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the Pope, an unholy Man of the wicked World's ſending, chuſing, and ſetting up, witneſs the Men chuſing him, and the manner of their chuſing and ſetting him up, the very relation of which, in all the Fooliſh and Antichriſtian Circumſtances of it, would even make a truly Honeſt Spiritual Man's Heartake to hear or read it. Again, <hi>Peter</hi> was a Humble Man, clothed with Humility, as he exhorted others; not a Lord over God's Heritage, but an Example to it of Faith and Goodneſs, as he exhorted others; but the Pope is a Proud Man, ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> like a Worldly Prince, Ruling and Lording it over God's He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, not only with his wicked Curſes and Excommunications of all that will not bow to his Superſtitions, and Abominable Idolatries, but even Perſecuting to Death with worldly Power and Force, (where he can do it, either by his own or others, whom he can ſtir up and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to act his wicked Will) all ſuch as deny him, and againſt him bear witheſs, though otherwiſe they be never ſo dear and near to the Lord God; and ſo inſtead of being an Example of Goodneſs to any, he is become an Abhorring to Nations; and therefore is the Wo come and coming upon him, and his Seat, and Upholders, and Lovers, from him who is a Conſuming Fire, and this <hi>Babylon,</hi> with all its Strength and Glory, ſhall be burnt in his Fire; and <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall not take one of her polluted Stones to put in her Holy Building.

                     <head>There is more by me of this kind, as in Anſwer to more Paſſages of that Bad Book herein mentioned, which in due time may come forth; and it is this.</head>
                     <p>Again, as concerning the Pope's ſuccceding <hi>Peter,</hi> and all Succeſſions relating to the Church of God, (truly ſo called) I ſay it is meerly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as the Lord ſaid concerning his Prophet, <hi>The Spirit that I have put upon thee, and the Word which I have put into thy Mouth, ſhall not depart from thee, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> And ſo we finding both the Spirit and Word of the Pope to be quite of another Nature than that which was in <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, we deny him and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, together with all other Pretenders to the like Succeſſion, who want that Heavenly Spirit, Life and Doctrine that they were in.</p>
                     <p>In the Ninth Article, this Bad Book ſaith, <hi>But why may not a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Man be ſaved in any Religion?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>Firſt, from</hi> Epheſ. 4.5. <hi>and</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>where mention is made of one Faith; and that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Then I ſay, well meaning in the Popiſh Way, without true Faith, will not ſave no more than in any other. But then ſaith he, <hi>Secondly, becauſe as in a natural Body, that part which hath not a due Connexion to the Heart or Root, preſently dies for want of Continuity: So in the Church, (the Myſtical Body of Chriſt)</hi> faith he, <hi>that Part or Member that hath not a due Subordination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion unto the Head, and Commen Councils thereof, that is the Pope and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> (thou ſhouldſt have ſaid Chriſt, as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15, 16.) <hi>from whence under Chriſt we have our Spiritual Life and Motion, as we are Chriſtians, muſt needs be dead, nor indeed can be accounted a Member of that Myſtical Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Profound Antichriſtian Doctrine indeed! For here thou haſt pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off thy Vizard with thy own Hand; and any one of a very mean Underſtandſtanding may ſee, that by this Popiſh Doctrine, Chriſt the Living Fountain is thruſt out of Doors, for it muſt not by this be known, what ſaith Chriſt and his Spirit to my Soul, but what faith the Pope and his Councils to mine Ear.</p>
                     <p>And afterwards this Pleader for <hi>Baal,</hi> to wit, the Pope and his Councils accounts them Noveliſts, Hereticks, and Idle Brains, that will not ſubmit to this Tribunal of Chriſt (he ſhould have ſaid Antichriſt) on Earth, to wit, the Pope and his General Councils, and makes this alone to be the Cauſe of all Hereſies and Sects, as he calls them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants or other; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they will not be tried by this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97179:194"/>but by their own idle Brain, and the dead Letter of the Scripture.</hi> To which I ſay, God will judge this Man, and all ſuch, for their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in coupling an idle Brain, and the Letter of the Scripture together; for though the Scripture be but as a dead thing to them that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand nor believe it, yet to an Inlightened, Underſtanding, Believing Soul, it is of ſuch Service, that the Apoſtle is not afraid to ſay, <hi>That the Scripture is given for our Learning, upon whom the Ends of the World are come:</hi> And the Scripture is of ſuch force in the Hand of ſuch Inlightned and truly Underſtanding Ones, that Chriſt made uſe of it againſt the great Wreſter of Scripture, to wit, the Devil; and by the right uſe of it in the hands of the Faithful, through the Spirit which gave them forth, all the Mud-walls of Popery, and Paper Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of the whole Antichriſtian Kingdom of Falſe Profeſſors, both have and daily are beat down; and therefore doth the wicked Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom keep the Holy Scripture from the poor Slaves under them. But the great King Chriſt Jeſus, upon his Heavenly Tribunal, is bringing his great Work to paſs in theſe latter days, againſt the Beaſt, Whore, and Falſe Prophet, under what Name or Notion ſoever; and by his Spirit, according to Scripture, to pour Judgments and Plagues upon all their Tribunals, Glory to his Name for evermore.</p>
                     <p>Again this Popiſh Book asks, <hi>Is not this</hi> (to wit, the want of a Popiſh Tribunal) <hi>the reaſon why the Proteſtants, and other Sects, are ſo divided,</hi> &amp;c. He anſwers, <hi>Yea, a principal reaſon; For how can different Fancies</hi> (ſays he) <hi>upon different Principles, be united?</hi> I anſwer, No: The want of this Tribunal is not the cauſe: And ask, What was the Reaſon of Differences amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that had their Tribunal of the Law outward, and High Prieſts, and Sanhedrims or great Councils, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Matters of Religion? Yea, and what was the reaſon that there was Diviſions and Diſſentions amongſt the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when even <hi>Peter</hi> and other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were living? Yea ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>There muſt be Hereſies among you</hi> (even you that all profeſs Chriſt) and he gives a Reaſon, <hi>that theſe that are approved may be made manifeſt:</hi> He doth not ſay, Hereſies come for want of a Pope and General Council. And I may add another Reaſon, and that a main and univerſal one, and that is, Peoples either not living in the Spirit, or not walking in the Spirit, and ſo not keeping <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace;</hi> And ſo not keeping the Head, to wit, Chriſt, in whom, if the whole Body be coupled and knit together, increaſe of the whole Body (to wit, the true Church) is made to the Edifying of it ſelf in Love, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

                     <p>To which I ſay, if any Proteſtant ſay, the whole Church of God is Fallible, and ſubject to Err, if they underſtand the Church as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. and as he doth in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. or as Chriſt doth in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not provail againſt it;</hi> they do not well: For though all Men, as Men, in <hi>Adam</hi> the Earthly, are not only Fallible, and ſubject to Err, but alſo really in Deceit and Error; yet in Chriſt Jeſus the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, that quickning, preſerving Spirit of Truth, there is no Fallibility nor Error, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>He that abideth in Chriſt ſinneth not,</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>And he that is Born of God ſinneth not, nor can ſin,</hi> Ver. 9. But what is all, or any of this Glory to the Pope, or his Synagogue, which he falſly calls the Church of God? For they do not attribute the Infallibility to the Eternal Spirit, which is in every true Member of Chriſt's Church, which is their Leader into and Preſerver of their Souls into all Truth, but to the Pope and General Councils; as though Infallibility were annexed to the Dream of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and not to Chriſt's Spirit in the Faithful. O the Abomination of Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in this Popiſh Doctrine!</p>
                     <p>But what, is there ſuch Unity amongſt theſe Deluded Diſciples of the Pope? Surely nay; for as we read there was amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſeveral Sorts and Sects of <hi>Phariſees, Sadducees, Libertines, Cirenians, Alexandrians,</hi> and the like, yet all againſt Chriſt: So in the Popiſh Hierarchy, there are the ſeveral different and divided Sorts and Sects of <hi>Franciſcans, Dominicans, Jeſuits, Cappuchins, Carthuſians,</hi> and others, all agreed this Day, as of long time they have been againſt the Bleſſed Crown, Kingdom, Dignity and Dominion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: But theſe, with all the reſt of Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Merchants, have cauſe to wail, becauſe the Light and Spirit of God in Chriſt Jeſus is broken forth in Power and great Glory this Day, to judge them all, that the Kingdom, (not Worldly, but Heavenly) may be given to the People of the Saints of the Moſt High God, for an Everlaſting Inheritance, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo I may well take notice of ſome other words that this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Pleader hath in his Book, Treating of this Matter, <hi>viz. Since then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be of one Religion, is to be of one ſetled Perſwaſion in Points of Faith, and ſeeling cannot be without Infallibility or Neceſſity; it is not well poſſible, that any two Proteſtants or Sectaries to be of one Religion, every Man Expounding the Scripture as he liſts, and no one having Power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the others Expoſition of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:97179:195"/>
                     <p>I Anſwer, and in the Power of Chriſt do grapple with this Beaſt that aroſe out of the Sea, and with his Image alſo, and do ſay, That no Humane Conceit, nor Natural Man's Expoſition, with the help of all the World's Wit and Skill, whether Pope, or other, is infallible, or binding, or controuling: But by the ſame Spirit that gave forth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (whether in a Fiſherman, Tradeſman, or other, now as well as formerly) is the Scripture rightly Underſtood and Expounded. So the true Oneneſs in Religion ſtands in the Oneneſs of that Spirit that gave forth Scripture, and gives a right underſtanding of it, and of all things, as the Apoſtle ſaith, The Anointing which ye have of the Holy One teacheth all things, and by it you know all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. And he that hath not this Spirit is none of Chriſt's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. And he that is guided by this Spirit is a Spiritual Man, and ſo not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or controuled in his Spiritual Concernment, by any Man of this World, (neither Pope, nor other) as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 15. It is ſo.</p>
                     <p>But whereas he tells of every Man Expounding the Scripture as he liſts, I ſay, this is the Pope and all his Prieſts Fault, and of all the wicked World beſides, who are not in Heart and Life ſubject to that one Pure and Holy Spirit, that is, of Jeſus, that leads Spiritually into all Truth, which Truth is one: And ſo though they that are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit may agree never ſo much, and in never ſo great numbers, in their ſeveral Ways of Deceit, yet the true Religion of God's Holy Ones in Light, they ſtill remain ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>And ſo his Blindneſs of imagining, that Proteſtants and Sectaries, as he calls them, cannot be two of them of one Religion, doth hereby fully appear: For not only they, but all the People of the Earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Name, Notion, or Profeſſion ſoever, are either the Children of Light, or Children of Darkneſs, and ſo not only two, but all of the ſame ſort may, and do agree in the Root in their Religion, (if it may be called ſo) though we know there is but one true Religion, and that is truly and properly the Religion of God's People, the Children of his Light, even that which in Purity and Holineſs binds their Hearts to God.</p>
                     <p>And ſo by this word Controuling, which this Remiſh Agent here uſeth, it is eaſily ſeen how the Pope hath ſet up and maintained his Wicked Kingdom, that is to ſay, by a Worldly Controuling Power over Mens Souls and Conſciences, and not by the Power of Truth: For if his Earthly Power, with his Worldly Aſſiſtants, were taken from him, his Decretals, Expoſitions, Bulls, Excommunications and Curſes, for not obeying his Commands, would be of little force this Day in the Earth, becauſe of the Light that God hath raiſed up in the Hearts
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97179:196"/>of People this Day to diſcover him, Glory to his Great Name for Evermore.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the true Judge and Controuler of all Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulers, is on his Throne this Day judging in Righteouſneſs, and on his White of Glorious Power, going on Conquering and to Conquer, the Man of Sin in all Lands, and his Holy Ones in Light: His Called, Faithful and Choſen follow him with great Joy of Heart, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11, 12, 13. <hi>He that hath an Ear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, ſaith this Popiſh Book, asking this Queſtion, <hi>Is the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>She is, and muſt be viſible at all times, as conſiſting of a Hierarchy of Paſtors, Governing, Teaching, and Adminiſtring Sacraments to the Worlds end; and of other People governed, taught, and receiving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments at their Hands, all publickly profeſſing the ſame Faith, all which things are viſible:</hi> And for this brings <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
                     <p>Anſwer, Now to this, I ſay, that the true Church, the Spouſe of Chriſt, (and not the Adulterer, the Popedom) are viſible and known to God, and its own Members, but inviſible to the World as ſuch, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God;</hi> therefore the World knows us not, becauſe it knew not him, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus their Head, though he did appear in Fleſh; and ſo the Fleſh was the Vail by which he was hid from the World then, as the Fleſh is the Vail by which the true Saints are hid from the World now: And this makes manifeſt that that Scripture <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. makes nothing for his Purpoſe at all.</p>
                     <p>And as for that other Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14, 15. where it is ſaid, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World, a City ſet on a Hill,</hi> which ſpeaks of them that were truly ſo, and kept their ſavour, and not at all for the Pope, or his great Army of Apoſtates, nor of any other who have the Name only of Chriſtians, but have loſt the good ſavour, and ſo want the true Chriſtian Life, and ſo having put the Candle under a Buſhel; though they may have a ſhew in outward Obſervances of their own deviſing of a Church, yet ſtill wanting the true heavenly ſavoury Life, I ſay, they are to be trodden under Foot of Men, as unſavoury Salt; and ſo this Scripture makes nothing for them neither.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may ſay, Though this makes not for the Pope, or any falſe Church, yet doth it not make ſomething for the viſibility of the true Church? I anſwer, No, not in the Popiſh or Worldly Senſe at all; for though the good Life of the true Church be very ſavoury to that of God in every Man, and the ſame Holy Life ſhining before Men, is of great Service to Men, and Glory to God; and ſo becauſe they ſeparate from the World, not only in the inward, but outwardly alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97179:196"/>they cannot be hid if they do any thing contrary to their Holy Profeſſion and Separation; yet ſtill the Apoſtle (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.) ſtands firm in his Teſtimony to which my Spirit agrees: Therefore the World knows us not, becauſe they knew not Chriſt: For how can the World, who are in the Falſe Life and Religion, and yet think it is true, know or believe them to be the True Church of Chriſt, who ſeparate from them, and bear witneſs againſt them. And this farther appears, if we conſider how the True Church, as Chriſt himſelf, was ever hated and perſecuted of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many other Scriptures: And wherefore is all this Enmity, but even becauſe the World knew them not as they were, but even accounted them, through their great Ignorance, as the Off-ſcouring of all things. As it is reported alſo concerning the Chriſtians in the Heatheniſh Perſecutions after Chriſt, <hi>Sejanus vir bonus ſed eſt Chriſtianus,</hi> Such a one is a good Man, but he is a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> So amongſt and by you called <hi>Papiſts;</hi> Such a one is a good Man, but he is a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> And amongſt the common <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> Such a one is a good Man, but he is a <hi>Quaker.</hi> Thus hath the true living Seed been vailed from the World, under ſome Reproach or other, through Ages and Generations, as at this day.</p>
                     <p>And ſo to conclude, I ſay, That which is here ſaid of the Inviſibility of the True Church, is not as this Popiſh Book would wickedly Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, Becauſe there were none called <hi>Proteſtants</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi>'s Time, (or becauſe others ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s Time have had other Names) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Truth, according to the Scripture of Truth, ſo judges, as is here in a few words ſet down.</p>
                     <p>But to return the Wickedneſs of theſe Popiſh Pleaders upon their own Heads, it may be truly ſaid, That the End of their Pleading ſo much for the Viſibility of the Church, is, Becauſe they have little in their Religion, if any thing at all, but what the blind and evil World can both ſee and exerciſe themſelves in, and yet continue ſtill in their ſinful Nature. So that the Pope's Daughter, the Popiſh Synagogue, is moſt unlike the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly King's Daughter, the True Church, which is all Glorious within; but the Pope and his Daughter, the Falſe Church, is all Foul within, and only Glorious on the out fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Apoſtle Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Titus</hi> to Exhort Believers to good Works, was not becauſe they were Saviours, but becauſe they were Profitable to Men, as well as the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>And as for our Religion, which the World, and all the outſide Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, look ſo ſlightly at, and ſpeak ſo Contemptibly of, we would have you, as well as the reſt, to know that it is truly Ancient <hi>Catholick, Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> as having its Riſe and Foundation in and from the Eternal Word, which is Chriſt in us, the Hope of our Glory, whom the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> Preached as a Myſtery formerly hid, but then Revealed to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even Chriſt in the Fleſh, the Hope of their Glory, through Faith in his Name; and this is God's Foundation, the Foundation of Chriſt's Church, another Foundation can no Man lay, than this which God hath laid; and this is the Rock, not <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Revelation of the Father, Confeſſed unto: And ſo through Faith in this Word, Chriſt the Foundation and Rock of all the Righteous, that ever were, or ever ſhall be, do we deny all the falſe Faiths and Works of all who have gotten the Name, but want the Nature of true Chriſtian People; and ſo in the true Faith which gives Victory over the World, and in the Name of Chriſt, which is above every Name, do we ſeparate from them, and meet together to Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, as he Requires us; and his Bleſſed Preſence in the midſt of us, according to Promiſe, do we abundantly feel and witneſs, to the great Rejoycing and Eſtabliſhing of our Souls in Righteouſneſs, when thus met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

I remember it's ſaid in Scripture, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> had blindfolded Chriſt, they Smote him, and wickedly ſaid unto him, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie who it is that Smote thee;</hi> (and was not this from the very ſame ground that this Scoffer ſpeaks) reaſoning, <hi>What, if thou be Chriſt, and a Prophet, thou canſt tell all things, and therefore thou canſt eaſily tell who Smote thee.</hi> Thoſe alſo did it for the very ſame end that this Man ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this to be done for, to wit, To try his Skill; But the Lord will

O Impiety! To what a height Wickedneſs is grown up in the Unbelievers and Mockers in this Age. But come ye Teachers of the Pariſhes, tell me, Do you indeed believe, or you do not, that <hi>John</hi> ſpoke true, when he ſaid, The Brethren had received <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy One, and they know all things?</hi> If you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Brethren then did, and that they now do, receive ſuch an Anointing: I ask you, What are thoſe <hi>All things</hi> that the Unction taught them, were they Heavenly or Earthly things? If Heavenly, even things pertaining to Salvation and Preſervation in a Saved State, as without all queſtion the Apoſtle did intend, as is plain there; and not ſuch earthly things as this Scoffer ſpeaks of. Then I ſay, this Scoffer is either very ignorant of the Scriptures, or he is very wicked in his Mind, in ſinning againſt Light, to make God's Children Odious. But the Cauſe of his Truth God will ever defend, and the Scorner he will Judge.</p>
                  <p>And for thoſe other words in that little Paper, where it is ſaid to <hi>Joſeph Holt, When thou doſt know me, do not pelt me with Reproaches; call me not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Prieſt, nor one of the World, as your Phraſes are; nor yet be ſo raſh as that Old Peeviſh Man at</hi> Sommerby <hi>was, to tell me I am Damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That I am the Man I ſuppoſe thou intends by that Old Peeviſh Man at <hi>Sommerby,</hi> and therefore whoever thou art, that ſays I ſaid thou art Damned, it was not ſo, but a meer Falſhood in thee to ſay ſo, for I never ſaid ſo to any man that I know of; but what I ſaid at that time at <hi>Sommerby</hi> againſt your Deceit, was not Raſhneſs nor Peeviſhneſs, but pure Zeal for God, which cauſed me to declare for God againſt you, for wreſting the Scripture, and abuſing the People thereby. What you are, by your Fruits is very manifeſt, he that runs may read what your in free is, by your Words and Works, the Day of the Lord hath found you out, and therefore if you repent not, you cannot miſs to periſh with all the Wicked that are gone before you, though we ſhould hold our Peace.</p>
                  <p>And ſo to call you that are Unrighteous, as by your Fruits is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and who by your own Service-book are tearmed Prieſts, I ſay, to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:97179:199"/>call you as you are, is neither Falſe nor Reproachful, when in the fear and feeling of God, it is ſo ſaid to or of you. But that you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your ſelves either wronged or reproached, if one tell you that you are of the World, is ſomething ſtrange, ſeeing the Courſe of your Lives is ſo in the broad way of the World, and your Spirits ſo Worldly, as not only by your earneſt Pleading for worldly Elements, ſo neceſſary to Salvation as outward Water, that you can hardly be perſwaded that any can be Regenerate or Saved without it; but alſo at your very Scoſſing at the Holy Anointing of the Spirit of God in his People, as is manifeſt; but without this Anointing of God, none knows Savingly any thing of the things of God's Kingdom; but for all that other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which is not of this Holy Anointing of God's Spirit, Man may be Brutiſh. And ſo I come, in the Ability I have from the Lord, to refute and make void thy Dark Thoughts, Arguments and Reaſons, for and concerning outward Waſhing or Sprinkling the little Infants with Elementary Water, mentioned in that firſt Paper.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, where from <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.14. thou draweſt theſe Arguments for Infant-Baptiſm. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſayeſt thou, <hi>Thoſe whom Chriſt would have brought unto him, it doth not at all become us to ſtop from Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That by this manner of wild Arguing, thou mayſt deceive the Simple, and lead the Blind into the Pit; but none, that in any meaſure are guided by God's Light, can be deceived with it: For what if I form thy words into a Syllogiſm (your <hi>Diana</hi>) there will no ſuch thing at all as Infant-Baptiſm ariſe from them, but only this, that thoſe ought not to be hindred from coming to Chriſt, whom he would have come to him. Unleſs you will ſay, That Chriſt Baptized thoſe Children with outward Water, which if you ſhould either ſay or think, it would be moſt Abſurd, and to be exploded by all. Neither was it in the deſire at all of them that brought the Children to Chriſt, to have them ſo Baptized, but as the words are, That he would put his Hands on them and Pray. But it ſeems you lay all the ſtreſs of the Service that can be done to Children, on Waſhing or Sprinkling them with Water, for without this, all your laying your defiled Hands upon them, and your ſinful praying over them, would do them little ſervice it ſeems; for indeed how ſhould it, ſeeing you never came to witneſs ſinleſs Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? For it's the Doctrine of the Higheſt amongſt you, that you ſin in your beſt Duties; and the words of your daily Service is, <hi>That there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o Health in you.</hi> And ſo Chriſt's Purifying Baptiſm we own for our ſelves and our Children, but yours we deny, for you have run, and God never ſent you, and therefore ſo little worth are all your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:97179:200"/>
                  <p>The other Argument from <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. is, <hi>Thoſe to whom the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven doth belong, and the Covenant of Grace, to thoſe alſo the Seal of that Covenant doth belong, which is Baptiſm,</hi> ſaiſt thou, <hi>but to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants doth belong this Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>and</hi> Acts 2.39.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, To this Argument much might be ſaid, to ſhew the fallacy and groſs deceit of it, but in a few words it is manifeſt thus; Firſt, I deny that part of the firſt or greater Propoſition, where thou Expoundeſt the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al of the Covenant to be Baptiſm, that is, Outward Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm. For though Outward Circumciſion was a Seal to the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Covenant, yet it doth not at all follow, that Outward Baptiſm or Waſhing is the Seal of the Covenant of God in Chriſt to Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; neither doth Outward Baptiſm ſucceed in the room or place of Outward Circumciſion, as you falſly all along ſuppoſe; but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumciſion of the Heart, is that which ſucceeds that in the Fleſh; and the Seal of God's Covenant with Man in Chriſt now, is his Holy Spirit of Promiſe, as the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom</hi> (to wit, in Chriſt) <hi>after ye believed, ye were ſealed with that Holy Spirit of Promiſe:</hi> So that now the Covenant being wholly Spiritual, and the Miniſtration of it Spiritual, the Seal of it muſt needs be ſo, to wit, the Seal of the Spirit; as it is ſaid in that place, which thou ſaiſt we omitted, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a Man be Born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which not at all ſpeaks of Outward Waſhing or Water, but of the Spirit only of God from above, as Chriſt's own words afterwards plainly ſignifie, where he ſaith, Ver. 6. <hi>That which is Born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that which is Born of the Spirit is Spirit:</hi> And Ver. 8. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo is every one that is Born of the Spirit;</hi> where Chriſt leaves out the mention of Water, as if on purpoſe to ſtop ſuch Carnal Conceits of his Work, as thine is; for the Seed of the New Birth, or Power, or Means, whereby Regeneration is wrought, is only of God, by the Operation of his Heavenly Spirit, and not by Outward Water, or any periſhing Thing whatſoever, as it is ſaid in another place, The Children of God are Born of the Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Seed of the Word of God, which lives for Ever: And ſo when <hi>Peter</hi> had mentioned our being ſaved by Baptiſm, to ſtop ſuch Carnal Conceivers as thee, he ſaith, Not the doing away or waſhing of the filth of the Fleſh is it, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus ſaves; which if thou hadſt an Ear to hear thou might hear</p>
                  <p>And for the Aſſumption, or other Propoſition of thy Argument, where thou ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſt, <hi>But to Infants doth belong this Covenant,</hi> and for that brings <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. I ſay there is a groſs fallacy or deceit in the Word Infants or Children, for it is an ambiguous, Tearm, and may be
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:97179:200"/>either underſtood of natural or fleſhly Infants, Children or Seed, or of the ſpiritual. But that that Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, was not to the fleſhly as ſuch, is moſt manifeſt by the Apoſtles Doctrine, where he on purpoſe ſpeaks of it in two Eminent places, to wit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. when he had ſaid, <hi>In thee</hi> (to wit, <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> he ſubjoins Ver. 7. So then they that be of Faith are Bleſſed with Faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi> And Ver. 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to Seeds, as of many; but of as one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> And Verſe the laſt, <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed, and Heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> Now may it not on the contrary be truly ſaid, If ye be not Chriſt's, then are ye not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, nor Heirs according to the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The next Scripture, is that which I mentioned upon this occaſion in my writing to you, which thou takeſt no notice of; for indeed it judges your Carnal Conceits of Things, and it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children: but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called. That is,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>They which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God: but the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> Was it not for ſuch Doctrine as this, that the Carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> like you Carnal <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> cried againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſaying, <hi>Away with ſuch a Fellow from the Earth, he is not worthy to live;</hi> as you uſe to cry againſt us to the People, for witneſſing to the Truth of Things againſt your Groſs and Carnal Conceits, and Unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Practices, <hi>Theſe People would Damn your Children:</hi> Nay, nay, we Damn none, but could wiſh that all might be Saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth. But ſay you, <hi>How can our Infants be Saved, if they be not Regenerate? And how can they be Regenerate, except they be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Outward Water?</hi> Poor Souls, I pity you in your great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie; Doth not the Scripture ſay in the fore-mentioned place, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but knows not whence it comes, and whether it goes:</hi> So is every one that is born of God's Spirit; And ſo Regeneration is not limited to any outward thing whatſoever: And for the little unteachable Children, thou buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, let them alone, till they be capable of Doctrine; and then, as any is able, let them bring them up in the Nurture and fear of the Lord, and ſo bring them to Chriſt, that he may lay his Hands upon them and Bleſs them. But ſecret things belong to God, not to thee: When things concerning the Children are known to thee, make good uſe of it, and anſwer the Lord's Mind in it; the Lord knows beſt what to do with the little Children Souls, which are hidden from thee; and let God alone with them who made them, he will have Mercy on whem he will have Mercy: And ſo let thy Sprinkling of them alone, for it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:97179:201"/>neither Regenerates them, nor Seals it unto them, but is a thing of Mens deviſing, which the Lord never required at your hands: And though Scriptures be wreſted by you to keep it up, and many Reaſons brought to prove it, yet I ſay, and I, and not I only, but many more, know in the Light it is proved, that there is not one Scripture rightly underſtood that is for it; nor one true Reaſon from Scripture to keep up your Sprinkling Infants: But it is a Cuſtom that in the Apoſtaſie had its Riſe, and by ſuch as are not recovered out of the Apoſtaſie, kept up and pleaded for.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſtir thou makeſt about ſomething that was ſaid by one of our Friends, about the Preſs that was about Chriſt, by People that came to be Healed, and that therefore the Diſciples might ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as tending to hinder the little Children from coming, and that the Children were brought upon other accounts to Chriſt, and not to be Baptized at all with outward Water. I ſay, thou wrongeſt our Friend, in mixing and charging words on him he ſpoke not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now that I ſee thee make ſo bad an uſe of his words, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent them, it is good time to take notice of thee.</p>
                  <p>And now I may add ſomething more concerning thy ungrounded Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thou bringeſt for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou ſayſt, <hi>Where the Diſeaſe is, there ought the Remedy to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; but the Diſeaſe, to wit, Original Sin, is in Children as well as Men: Therefore the Remedy, which is Baptiſm, ought to be applied to Children as well as Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That by this both thy ſelf, and all that take part with thee in this thing, are manifeſt to be like the Papiſts in this Point about Infant Baptiſm, for they hold that Baptiſm of Infants waſhes away Original Sin, and ſo do theſe Engliſh Prieſts it ſeems. I knew that you were Idolaters from the Womb, giving that to the Creature which is proper to the Creator: If the Diſeaſe be Original Sin, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy be outward Baptiſin, then it ſeems thoſe that are ſo cured, muſt certainly be ſaved; then it's no Wonder, though poor People, that are perſwaded of this Lie, do run ſo faſt to you with their Children to be Sprinkled; and no wonder that they do ſo admire you, and worſhip you, that are ſuch Saviours; and none muſt be thought worthy to do it, it ſeems, but your ſelves: O ſad Work! But by this Craft you get great Livings, and that pleaſes your Carnal Mind well; But God will judge for all ſuch things: And if this Tradition of yours were true, How can ever any, that have Original Sin ſo cured and waſhed from them, Sin at all? For take away the Cauſe and Root of a thing, and the Effect and Fruit which comes and ſprings from them muſt needs
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97179:201"/>ceaſe alſo. And therefore thy Interpretation of the Remedy againſt Original Sin, that it is outward Water-Baptiſm, which thou didſt mention in thy Argument, I do utterly deny, and do, with all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light, pronounce it to be contrary to the Word of God, for God's Word is Truth, and no Lie is of, but contrary to, the Word of Truth. And ſo where the Door or In-let into your Church, is ſuch an unſound Doctrine as this, what a Church is that. And now if thou couldſt convert to Truth, according to thy ſeeming Promiſe, it would be well for thy Soul. <hi>Therefore whilſt it is called to day, harden not thy Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thy ſecond Reaſon is anſwered already, in ſhewing thy falſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that place of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thy third Reaſon, <hi>No means of Salvation ought to be denied to the Children of the Faithful, whereof they are capable, but Baptiſm is an outward means of Salvation, whereof Children are capable under the Goſpel, as well as Children of the Jews were capable of it under the Law; therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſay, Though in a general Sence,
<note place="margin">Your own grant that Inſants cannot obſerve the Requiſites of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to wit, Faith and Repentance ſhews their Incapacity for it.</note> the Major Propoſition, as you tearm it, may be granted, but reſtrained to your Sence: I ſay, that before you inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle your Children to Priviledges, becauſe of your Faith, you had need prove your ſelves to be in the Faith, which yet you have not done, leſt both the Root, Tree and Branches fall all together. And for the Minor, as you tearm it, I ſay it is falſe, that your Sprinkling is any means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to your ſelves or your Children, becauſe, as is proved, it hath no ground nor footing in the Truth, but a meer Invention of Man's wanting both Precept and Preſident in the Scriptures of Truth: And for Children being capable of it under the Goſpel, I ask how capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Doſt thou ſay they underſtand what is done to them in it, or can make any Spiritual uſe of it in their Infancy? Then I ſay, The Multitude ſhall condemn thee, and the leaſt in the Flock witneſs againſt thee: But if thou ſay they are capable of it, only ſo as to ſuffer it to be done on them without underſtanding, then I ſay it is no Goſpel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Capacity, for in the Goſpel Miniſtration all muſt be done and received in and with the Spirit and Underſtanding, except you will joyn hands again with the Papiſts, and ſay <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> to wit. From the Work of the Prieſt done upon them they are ſaved. O ſad! That ever we ſhould have occaſion to ſpeak thus to a People, after ſo long a time of profeſſing the Scripture and Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:97179:202"/>4. The fourth Reaſon ſpeaks all as it were in one, and doth fully make manifeſt the Darkneſs in thee, from whence all thy Unchriſtian Doctrines have proceeded, and it is this, <hi>All thoſe who receive the thing ſignified by Baptiſm, ought to receive the outward Sign, it is the Argument of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be Baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? But Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Faithful receive the thing ſignified by Baptiſm,</hi> to wit, <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Remiſſion of Sins: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To thy firſt Propoſition drawn from <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. thou might have left that to others, who Idolize outward Baptiſm in another Form; for they will tell thee, it belongs nothing to you at all who Sprinkle before Confeſſion, or any viſible Appearance of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work. But then ſayſt thou, <hi>If Children be not Regenerated, and receive Remiſſion of Sins, you muſt needs hold, that all Children are damned.</hi> I ſay, thou belies us and the Truth, for there is no neceſſity at all for ſuch a wild and falfe Concluſion from our true and harmleſs Premiſes, for what though God pleaſe to have Mercy upon Children, whether ſome or all, whom and as he pleaſeth; What ground is that for you to ſay hand over head, that all that you Sprinkle are Regenerated, when you know nothing at all of God's Mind in the thing? And for your calling ſuch Children of the Faithful, who naturally only proceed from ſuch as do but in general only profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, though their Lives, even in your Judgment, are judged to be no better; ſome, if not many of them, to be, I ſay, no better than <hi>Heathens,</hi> is ſuch a piece of Darkneſs and Wretchedneſs, that the Earth groans under it; and the Spirit of the Lord is burdened with your Doings, as a Cart under Sheaves. And whereas thou brings that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. to prove, that by little Children he intends the Natural Infants, is ſo groſs, that it ſhews thou wilt not ſee; for thoſe little ones, whoſe Angels, Chriſt ſaid, did always behold the Face of his Father, are plainly ſaid to be ſuch as believed in him; Ver. 6. and humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like a little Child; and ſo he ſtill brought little Children as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Examples to Men, that they might come to the Birth of God in them which Heirs his Kingdom, according to what is ſaid before <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. and <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>That which is Born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that which is Born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo as to that which thou brings againſt our Objection from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. concerning Infant Baptiſm, it is nothing but thy groundleſs Argument drawn from a falfe Suppoſition of our underſtanding of the place, as though we underſtood the reaſon wherefore Teaching is to go before Baptizing, becauſe of the meer ſtanding of the words in the Sentence, and ſo troubles thy ſelf to prove by other Scripture, That
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:97179:202"/>Precedency of Action is not always deducible from the Precedency of Words: For thou maiſt know, that we do not ſay that Teaching goes before Baptiſm, meerly becauſe it is placed ſo in words, (though in that place that is true) but eſpecially becauſe of the Nature of the Thing, as is manifeſt amongſt many other Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By your own Confeſſion, that the Sacraments do not beget Faith, but only confirm; and that Faith cometh by hearing the Word Preached.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Practice of thoſe that Baptized with Water in the firſt Times, as is to be ſeen in Scripture, where none were Baptized with Water, but upon Teaching firſt, going to the Underſtanding of ſuch, whatſoever you imagine to the contrary, from the Goaler's or <hi>Stephana</hi>'s Families.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the Judgment of thoſe that Compiled that Catechiſm, which ſaith, <hi>What is required of Perſons to be Baptized?</hi> The Anſwer is, Faith and Repentance: And ſo becauſe they in their dark Minds and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, would needs have Children into that Ceremony, (right or wrong) they deviſed that ſtrange, and unheard of, and unreaſonable Cuſtom of Sureties, or Godfathers and Godmothers, to Promiſe that for the Children which the Lord never required of them, and indeed is moſt unreaſonable to think poſſible; for can any Promiſe for another that they ſhall do ſuch things, as forſake the Devil and all his Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially for Infants, whoſe Minds and Hearts are wholly hid from ſuch Preſumptuous Promiſers. But what if the Lord ſhould require the Performance of this Promiſe in the Day of Judgment, on behalf of ſuch Infants, that when they come to Years are found following the Devil and all his Works? Would'ſt thou be content to ſuffer the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſuch Diſobedient Ones for their Sin? Were it not juſt thou ſhould'ſt, ſeeing thou waſt the Surety or Undertaker for them, and they have failed? Muſt it not therefore fall on thee, except thou Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? And ſo if thou be Damned, do not ſay that we Damn thee, for it's thy ſelf that art the Cauſe, and God and his Servants are clear of all your Blood: And do not trifle and ſay as one of you ſaid, See theſe Men can bring a Proof out of our Catechiſm, and therefore it is ſo and ſo; and drew this wretched word forth from it, The Spider draws Poyſon out of the ſame Flower the Bee draws Honey. The <hi>Heathens</hi> might have ſaid ſo to <hi>Paul,</hi> who brought their own Authors againſt them: And did his bringing ſome true words out of their heaps of falſe, prove all to be good, and he a Spider for ſo doing, any more than our preſent Work make us Spiders, or allow of all that's written in that Catechiſm? Nay, nay, the Lord is Judge between us, and he ſees who are in Heart true Lovers of him and his Truth, and who are not,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97179:203"/>and will give every one according to their Works, and that is our Joy, Glory to his Name for Ever; and ſo at this time reſts the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</p>

If yea, then tell us upon what Scripture Proof your Faith is grounded, ſeeing there is no Water there mentioned: And if ſome were then Baptized in Water a ſecond time, why then may there not be as much Neceſſity now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as have not received the Holy Ghoſt at their firſt plunging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water, to be Baptized again in Water a ſecond time?

But tell us plainly, whether it be your Act of Dipping in Water that you call Sacred, or the Water in which you Dip or Plunge People? Or where you had that Tearm to call your Water-baptiſm Sacred, if not from the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wherefore are you offended at us for calling your Baptizing in Water, Dipping or Plunging, ſeeing that we underſtand to be the import or ſignification of the Word in plain Engliſh.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

And have you received that Promiſe and Power? If yea, what is it? A Book, or Books, or Writings without, or the Spirit, Power, and Life of Chriſt revealed within? But and if you have not obeyed Chriſt's Command as aforeſaid, but run before you have received that Power, are you not therein manifeſt Tranſgreſſors of the Doctrine and Command of Chriſt, even in that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Ground and Rule of your Faith and Miſſion?

                  <p n="12">12. Was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> any whit inferior or behind the very Chief Apoſtles? And was not that Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. as much his as yours? And did not he know the Mind of Chriſt in it, as fully as any of you the Counſel of God, being revealed to him? Notwithſtanding which, did not he expreſly teſtifie that Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.) but to Preach the Goſpel? Now if you have a Miſſion or Commiſſion to Baptize in Water, which belongs not to him as fully as to any of you, tell us plainly who gave it when you received it, and your Scripture for it?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Do you believe that <hi>Paul</hi> was Called and fully Endued for the Miniſtry? And was his Commiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. Evangelical and Full, for the Gathering and Planting of Churches according to Goſpel-Order, ſeeing we find nothing in it of Chriſt's ſending him to Baptize? Or do you think his Commiſſion inſufficient for the End aforeſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not ſent to Baptize in Water, and that yours now is more Full and Evangelical? If you do, tell us what Scripture have you for the Ground and Rule of your Faith in that Matter.</p>
                  <p n="14">14.

                  <p>And firſt, thou <hi>T.

Nay, there is more Charge and Command lyes upon the Obſervation of the Law, than for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as by</hi> Moſes<hi>'s ſeveral places of Warning, and in reſpect of ſeveral Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; though it be ſaid,</hi> He that harkens not to the Prophet Chriſt, ſhall be cut off, <hi>there is as much ſpoken of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:97179:209"/>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Who but an Unbelieving <hi>Jew</hi> could ever thus have gone about to Undervalue and Dethrone the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as this <hi>Tho. Hall</hi> doth, who lays more weight upon the Obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s law, which had the Shadow, than upon the Everlaſting Goſpel of the Son of God, and ſo he neither believes <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Prophets, nor Chriſt, and ſo he is captivated in the great Captivity of the Spiritual <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the Devil, who hath blinded his Mind, leſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine unto him. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. For <hi>Moſes</hi> writ of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall raiſe thee up a Prophet like unto me, him ſhalt thou hear in all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord Jeſus being this Prophet when he appeared in the Days of his Fleſh, he made manifeſt to ſuch as believed in him what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them then, and the reſt of the Fathers Mind and Will after his Aſcention, by his Bleſſed Spirit, as he ſaid <hi>John</hi> 16.12, <hi>&amp;c. I have yet many things to ſpeak unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak; and he will ſhew you things to come: He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.

                  <p>So by this it's evident, that this <hi>T. H.</hi> ſpeaks not by the Spirit of Truth, for he would ſet up <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant above Chriſt the Lord of all; and ſo inſtead of glorifying Chriſt, diſhonours him exceedingly.</p>

And ſo in the Transfiguration, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> the Servants were gone, Chriſt only was left with an Eternal Witneſs of God out of the Bright Cloud, ſaying, <hi>This is my Beloved Son, hear him,</hi> Mat. 17.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo this <hi>Tho.

                  <p>See what thou haſt choſen, <hi>Tho. Hall:</hi> How thou haſt choſen the Earthly before the Heavenly, the Killing Letter before the Heavenly Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, which giveth Life; and the Shadowing Law of the Servant before the Living Law of the Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>was counted worthy of more Glory than</hi> Moſes, <hi>in as much as he that Builded the Houſe, is more worthy than the Houſe.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>But when we ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law is a killing Letter, and made nothing perfect, this <hi>T. Hall,</hi> like a wicked Man, is ready to cry out of us, as though we broached ſome new or ſtrange Doctrine, when as it is no other than the plain downright Doctrine of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Servants of the Lord Jeſus, ſet down in Scripture, as you may read, without our adding or diminiſhing any thing at all. And to this purpoſe ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. where are theſe words Verſe 6, &amp;c. <hi>Who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.

For if the Miniſtration of Condemnation be Glory, much more doth the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs exceed in Glory.

                        </gap> that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. Seeing then that we have ſuch hope, we uſe great plainneſs of Speech. And not as</hi> Moſes, <hi>which put a Vail over his Face, that the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed; But their Minds were blinded: For until this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the ſame Vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Teſtament; which Vail is done away in Chriſt. But even unto this day, when</hi> Moſes <hi>is read, the Vail is upon their Heart. Nevertheleſs, when it ſhall turn to the Lord, the Vail ſhall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here this <hi>T.

For the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath ſet me free from the Law of Sin and Death. For that which the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh,</hi> Chriſt doth in us and for us. And that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> made nothing perfect, it is the Apoſtles expreſs words alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>For there is verily a diſanulling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment going before</hi> (that is, as he reaſons all along in this Chapter, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Letter) <hi>for the Weakneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs of it:</hi> (ſuitable to that before mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better Hope did; by which we draw nigh unto God.</hi>

                  <p>And ſo thou <hi>T.

                  <p>And Page 15 further erroniouſly thou ſay'ſt, <hi>You</hi> Quakers <hi>cannot find as that Chriſt the Prophet did give any Command to any People, as was in ignorance of the Ways to Salvation, or Life Eternal, that they ſhould leave off to be taught of</hi> Moſes, <hi>or his Law, or Precepts, and go to learn of the Spirit of Truth, and let that teach or lead them, God forbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O miſerable Blindneſs and Ignorance! That ever any Profeſſing God or Scripture, ſhould thus belch out their Enmity againſt the Spirit of Truth. The glorious Promiſe of the Father, without which all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all Profeſſion, is a meer Nothing, but a heap of Darkneſs and Confuſion, and without which there had never been any true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor Scripture of Truth; for Holy Men of God ſpoke not in their own Wills or Times, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt (the Spirit of Truth) without which never Man did, nor never Man can, come to any Saving Knowledge of God or Chriſt, or the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God and Chriſt; and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (after many Years zealous Profeſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s killing Letter) <hi>That which the Eye hath not ſeen, nor the Ear heard, nor hath entred into Man's Heart</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit of God</hi> (that Spirit of Truth) <hi>ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. And therefore ſaith the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. <hi>God hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.</hi> And therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> that the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth, may come, who is the Saints Comforter. And this is that means by which the Father draws to Chriſt, even the Spirit of Truth (and not as thou ignorantly Dreameſt) the Letter of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. And ſo, <hi>T. Hall,</hi> thou art not far from that unpardonable Sin of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, who ſays, <hi>That if Chriſt had directed the Man in the Goſpel to go to the Spirit of Truth, and wait for it, he had directed him out of the

                  <p>And thou, <hi>T. Hall,</hi> ſay'ſt farther, <hi>God forbid that Chriſt ſhould ſend or direct People that were in Ignorance of the ways of Salvation, to go and learn of the Holy Spirit of Truth, to be taught of it, and not at</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay again, This proceeds from the ſame bitter Root of Error and Blaſphemy in thee that the former did; and ſo Wo, Wo, Wo, to that Neſt that hatches ſuch Venomous Birds, and Cockatrice Eggs, as thou doſt: And if that People, of whom thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf a Member, ſhould ſee theſe things, and not deny thee for them, they would be as much to blame as thy ſelf, who haſt plunged thy ſelf ſo deep into the Pit of Deſtruction, that no leſs than a Miracle of Mercy can help thee to ſee and acknowledge the Truth of God whom thou haſt Blaſphemed. For O thou full of all Unrighteouſneſs! What muſt ignorant People come to know the things of God by, but only by the Spirit of Truth? as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>No Man knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11.

H.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, <hi>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of Faith?</hi> And Verſe 3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the Fleſh?</hi> Thus he ſhews, That the Spirit of God is received into the Believing Soul, through the hearing of Faith preach'd, and not by any fleſhly conforming to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Letter of that Law; for ſaith he in Ver. 10. of that Chapter, <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> See <hi>T. Hall,</hi> what thou haſt done for thy ſelf (and wouldſt do for others) by pleading for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Letter of the Law to be over Chriſtian People; thou haſt brought thy ſelf under the Curſe; for they that come under that Covenant of Works, muſt not only do all things written in the Book, but they muſt continue therein without Sinning or Offending againſt it, otherwiſe they are Curſed; as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in another place ſaith, <hi>He that keepeth the whole Law, and ſinneth in one Point, is guilty of all.</hi> And ſo, as I inſtanced to thee in that of the Sabbath day, for though in thy blind Mind thou wouldſt be a Teacher of the Law, yet thou neither knoweſt what thou ſay'ſt, nor whereof thou affirmeſt, for the Sabbath-day, which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded to the People under that Covenant, was the Seventh day of the Week, which thou neither keepeſt thy ſelf, nor any of thy Fellows, and ſo you are guilty of breaking the whole Law, and ſo under the Curſe. And whereas you think to ſave your Heads,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97179:212"/>by ſaying, You keep the next day, being the Firſt day of the Week, for a Sabbath; that will help you nothing at all, for the Law admitted of no change of the day (which was the Seventh from the Creation) into another day: And ſo the Apoſtles meeting together on the Firſt day of the Week, was ſo far from eſtabliſhing the legal Sabbath, that it was on purpoſe done, to ſhew that Chriſt, the end of the Law, and everlaſting Sabbath of Reſt to his People, was come. And ſo to thee <hi>T. Hall,</hi> and all of like mind with thee, I ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 4.21, &amp;c. <hi>Tell me, ye that deſire to be under the Law, Do ye not hear the Law? For it is written,</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sons, the one by a Bond-woman, the other by a Free. But he who was of the Bond-woman, was born after the Fleſh; but he of the Free woman, was by promiſe. Which things are an Allegory, for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendereth to Bondage, which is</hi> Agar. <hi>For this</hi> Agar <hi>is Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and anſwereth to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which now is, and is in Bondage with her Children. But</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoyce, thou barren, that beareſt not, break forth and cry, thou that travelleſt not, for the Deſolate have many moe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than thee which hath an Husband. Now we, Brethren, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was, are the Children of the Promiſe. But as then, he that was born after the Fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, what ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the Bond woman and her Son; for the Son of the Bond-woman ſhall not be Heir with the Son of the Free-woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſee <hi>Tho. Hall</hi> where thou art, a Child of the Bond-woman, Born after the Fleſh, Perſecuting us whom God of his Free Love in Chriſt Jeſus, hath Begotten and Born Spiritually unto himſelf, to Serve and Worſhip him in his own Free Spirit, and ſo in the ſame to bear witneſs for him, againſt thine, and all the Slanderous Lying Tongues and Pens, who will not have Chriſt by his Eternal Spirit of Truth to Rule, yea, to be King, Law-giver and Saviour in his People: But this Wicked Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Spirit of yours, as the Lord both hath and will by the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Appearing diſcover, ſo he will likewiſe, by the Spirit of his Mouth, utterly conſume, and for Ever deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Lord Jeſus, the Son of the Father, ſhall Triumph over thee and all his Enemies in Righteouſneſs; for though the Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was for the time until Chriſt came to the <hi>Jews,</hi> of great uſe, yet Chriſt being come, the Promiſed Seed, Grace and Truth, yea, Life and Immortality in its Glory was made manifeſt and enjoyed in the Believers both then and now, and did as far, yea, much more tranſcend the Glory of the Law, as the Sun doth the Moon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jews,</hi> the whole Fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had their New-Moon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97179:212"/>Feaſts, to ſignifie the ſhadowy Night Diſpenſation they were under, ſhort of the Day; and therefore ſaith <hi>Malachi,</hi> the laſt Prophet under the Law ſave <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in his laſt Chapter, <hi>To you that fear my Name, ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing under his Wings:</hi> ſo though in the Law there was Condemnation againſt Sin, yet the Life and Healing Vertue is only in Jeſus Chriſt. And this is the very thing that <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 1. ſaith, <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So that the Offender under <hi>Moſes</hi> died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy; but the Believer in Chriſt, and the Abider through Faith in Chriſt, is Healed by the Mercy that is in him, to all that ſo are found in him. And ſo you that daily Confeſs you do what you ought not to do, and leave undone what you ought to do, and have no Health in you, you ſhew plainly that you never yet knew Chriſt, but are yet in your Sins under the Law, which makes nothing perfect; and ſo all your Righteouſneſs in this ſtate, is like menſtruous Rags indeed, and your beſt Works Sin; and ſo <hi>you being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to eſtabliſh your own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, which is Chriſt. For that no man is juſtified in the ſight of God by the Works of the Law is evident, for the Juſt ſhall live by Faith.

                  <p>Another Piece of thy Enmity <hi>(Tho.

                  <p>And ſo let no Man trouble us any more, for we bear in our Bodies the Marks of the Lord Jeſus: And Ever-praiſed be his Name, who hath given us an Underſtanding to know him, the Salvation of God, to be <hi>in us,</hi> and we in him; and ſo to be Witneſſes for him before Men, that the time of the fulfilling of his Scriptures is come, which ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>Now mind, whoever thou art, that reads theſe words, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which here he calls Old, was that which God made with the Fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> at their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as you may read; and part of this Covenant was the Two Tables of Stone, which the Lord by his Angel delivered <hi>Moſes</hi> for that People to obſerve and keep, with the reſt of what <hi>Moſes</hi> had in Charge for them, and ſet down in the outward Book, to be done, and which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did Promiſe and Covenant that they would obſerve and do, but they broke Covenant with God, (as all Fleſh ever did, and doth at this Day) and ſo the Lord regarded them not; for no Fleſh can do what the Pure Spiritual Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, having no more help thereto, but what a Law or Letter without can furniſh them withal; and therefore the Lord God in love to Man's Soul ſent Chriſt into the World, to be his own Arm and Power to and in Man, to bring forth that Righteouſneſs and Holineſs which he required; and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> after he ſaw his own ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unableneſs to do the Will of God, with all the outward Helps that ever he had, he concludes, that they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, let them turn which way they can; for the Enmity againſt the Law, whilſt in that Principle, (and in that thou <hi>T.

                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo muſt all come to Chriſt, the Lord that Spirit, to know him in them, to deſtroy the Enmity out of them; that ſo the Will of God, and Law of his Mouth, which is Spiritual, may be done in them; and ſo come to witneſs as <hi>Paul</hi> there in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. did, That <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made</hi> them <hi>free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> And the Ground or Reaſon of the Lord's gracious Dealing with Man, in the next Verſe e ſets down, ſaying, <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemned Sin in the Fleſh.</hi> And the end of all this he ſhews in the

For now indeed is the day of the Lord God appeared; and the Lamb is come, and who may ſtand before him? who can abide this day of his coming? for he cometh in the thouſands of his Holy Ones to Judge the World, even all that are Proud and do Wickedly in his ſight, and to convince them of all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deeds and hard ſpeeches, which they ungodlily have ſpoken againſt him, and whereby they have ſlandred the foot ſteps of his Anointed Ones, and blaſphemed his Heavenly Tabernacle, which he hath pitched amongſt men that he might dwell amongſt them and be glorified for evermore.</p>
                  <p>So WOE is to the Wicked, and much Wrath will be upon the people who now ſtand out and ſtrive againſt the Lord, even the Lord, the habitation of Juſtice, in whoſe hands is their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>WHEN the Lord God of Eternal Power began, by his Spirit, to move in theſe Nations, in the late times of Trouble, and there was an Opening in the times for the Zeal of the Heart to work out it ſelf, then every one betook themſelves to that Fellowſhip and People that agreed moſt with the Working-Principle that was in them, and ſo there came a distinguiſhing and knowledge of thoſe ſeeking Souls, according to ſome thing most obvious to the Eye of the World, and ſo they called ſome by the name of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſome <hi>Independent,</hi> and the like: For, as for thoſe called <hi>Prelatical,</hi> they were not of ſuch a preſſing Nature, as to ſeek forward much after the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but rather Breathed after their Old Form, how they might come to that again, (without the former Troubles) to lye down in that: But thoſe called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or mixed <hi>Independent</hi> (in anſwer to whoſe Queries, or one of them, the enſuing ſheets are) they ſeemed ſo Zealous while the Worlds Power countenanced them, as though they would have taken Heaven, as it were by force; and not only ſo, but even of late alſo, ſince the Second <hi>Charles</hi> came in, and they began to be put out of their high Places by ſome old Incumbent, as they call them, or upon ſome other Account, as Zealor ſo, yet did ſome of them keep up their Custom of Preaching amongſt People in publick, where they could get place or audience, in ſo much that the boaſting Spirit began to get up in ſome of them, as in this <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> as though nothing ſhould ſtop their paſſage, and ſo would have all accounted Liars that had ſaid to the Contrary: But behold the Wiſdom if God in ſuffering things ſo to come to paſs, that all things might be fully manifeſt: And ſo an

                        <hi>JOHN REYNOLDS,</hi> A Paper of Queries (coming to my hand) as ſeems from thee to <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton</hi> of <hi>Dudly,</hi> and weighing it well, I could not but in obedience to God write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, not ſo much for the uſe of theſe two young men, who by the Light that God hath raiſed in them do ſee thy deceit therein, as for the ſake of ſome ſimple people who are as yet admirers of thee, and deceived by thee, and ſuch like who under a pretence of zeal for the letter of Scripture, and things you have ſet up in your wills under the name of Ordinances, not knowing nor conſidering that Chriſt is come, the end of all things to them that believe: Though you may ſometimes unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly light on Scriptures, that ſpeaks the thing; and ſo if by what here may be ſaid, the Truth may more appear, and their ſimple Souls be helped, God will be Glorified, and that will be Reward ſufficient: But before the Queries themſelves be anſwered, ſomething may be ſaid, to that which goes before them in that Paper, and from that I have noted the nature of thy Fawning, Flattering, Self-contradicting and Confuſed Spirit; but to hide that from the Light, thou backs thy ſayings with quotations of Scripture, as though mentioning what the Holy Men of God ſpoke by the true Spirit, could prove that to be a true Spirit which acts in thee: Nay, nay, the day is dawned Praiſed be God; and the Sheepskin no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can hide the Wolves from being ſeen of the Lambs of Chriſt, for ſuch hear Chriſts Voice and follow him, and ſo are Children of the Light, but the Stranger they will not follow, though he may Paint him ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver never ſo cunningly with words, but all your fair words in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your work, ye Fair-ſayers, whether in Pulpit or in Preſs, is but to make way for your ſting that follows, for you reſemble the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion whoſe ſling is in his Tail, mentioned in <hi>Revelations:</hi> for the end of all thy fair words here, is but to draw theſe young men from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, and his Light that Lighteth every man that cometh into the World, for the great Malice of thy Heart, is againſt the ſufficiency of Chriſts Light in every man; and ſo would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be added to it from without, that ſo thou may'ſt bring in thy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97179:81"/>own traditions; but what condition ſhall one gather by thy words, theſe two Men <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton,</hi> were in at the writing of theſe Queries to them, for one while thou ſeemeſt to apply Scriptures reſpecting the conditions of the unbelieving Jews to them, and another while thou applies thoſe that reſpect the condition of pretty well-grown Chriſtians: But however the ſum of all is, to perſwade them from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Light of Chriſt in them, as not being ſufficient, and ſo thy love is not teſtified unto them in Deed and in Truth, as thou ſay'ſt it is, but in meer Hypocriſie and Deceit, as may further appear: But what is that Soul enlightning Commandment <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29.8. Whereby thou ſeemeſt to deſire they may be enlightned? Is it this letter without, or the Light of Chriſt within? If thou ſay the letter, as thou muſt ſay, or elſe thwarts the whole current of thy Doctrine, and then all that have Eyes may ſee thee to be an outward Jew only: But if thou ſay with us, it is the Light of Chriſt that ſhineth in Darkneſs, <hi>John</hi> 1. which at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God ſhineth out of Darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Glory to Man in the Face of Chriſt, then the buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sufficiency of the Light between us is at an end, and the Truth ſtands over the from thy own words. The next is, when thou heareſt the Scripture mentioned thy Windy, Slightly, Crafty Doctrine of Deceivers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. then thou ſhoots thy Sting at the Innocent, and would'ſt have People believe that is to be applyed to us who Preach Chriſt and his all-ſufficiency in, and for every one that can Receive Him, who is near every Man, and by his Light ſhineth to Conviction and Judgment in every Man, who would have all Men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of his Truth, which is nigh in the Heart and in the Mouth; but this was the Apoſtles Doctrine, and ſo not to be condemned in us, but thou goeſt on, telling of two ways of Deceiving, the one thou nameſt the upper way (which thou ſay'ſt) is by Philoſophy, the Traditions of Men, Rudiments of the World, and Sciences falſly ſo called: And Praiſed be God, thou art as it were forced by the Light in thy Conſcience to acquit us from being of this Number; but truly the Light in our conſcience tells us expreſly, that thou <hi>John Reynolds</hi> art one of them that arei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ou would'ſt condemn, for the difference is not in the nature of your Doctrine, but in the form. And ſo though an Idol of Gold appear more beautiful than one of baſer mettle, yet it is an Idol ſtill, and ſo you are both in the Fighting and Perſecuting nature, as all Idolaters are; <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſch</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> one for the Common-Prayer, another for the Directory, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97179:81"/>will own the Lambs Light in you, to Teach and Guide you; and ſo though you may have a Form of Godlineſs more Painted than they, yet denying the Power (Chriſt in man) you are all alike to be turned away from: And ſo <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton</hi> in turning from thee, as well as the other Formaliſts, are excuſeable; and though thou goeſt about to perſwade them from the Truth, by telling them of a lower way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by a voluntary Humility, and neglecting of the Body, and wearing a rough Garment to deceive, which thou would'ſt intimate to be our condition, yet this will not deceive their minds, if they keep to the true Light of Chriſt in them, for in that they feel our Garment to be ſmooth and ſweet, through the Fathers Love, not rough or hairy, as the Hypocrites is, who kill one another about their ways of Worſhip; but for voluntary Humility in the will offered up by heaps, which is no better than filthy ſmoke in the noſtrils of a pure God in this day; and Praiſed be God that hath brought us from this into the true Humility: but how thy words of accuſing us here of neglecting the Body, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Drunkenneſs, can agree, let the wiſe in Heart conſider; but all in thy changeable nature and unſtable muſt needs be Self-contradictors; and ſo who be the Thieves that Chriſt in this day is Crucified between, is thus far in part, and will afterwards God willing more appear. Alſo it is obſervable from that Preface of thine further, where it is ſaid that this latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Namely, the lower way of deceiving may poſſibly prevail, though not with the preſent Multitude, yet ſome unſtable Souls that have been none enlightned and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Power of the World to come, but are not yet rooted and ſettled in the Truth and grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; then I ſay, thou need'ſt not fear any of thy followers to be deceived on this manner, for none can be ſavingly enlightned who denies the ſufficiency of Chriſts Light, the Grace of God, which hath appeared to all Men; yea, in their Darkneſs ſhineth, though the Darkneſs comprehend it not, as thou doſt not; and none can ſay in Truth they have taſted the Good Word of God who puts the Letter for it, and denies the ſufficiency of Chriſts Light, which is his Word nigh in the Heart and Mouth, as thou doſt; nor none can truly be ſaid to taſte the Powers of the World to come, who deny to bow their Hearts to the leaſt Meaſure of Chriſts Light in them, accounting it inſufficient, as thou doſt: And ſo it is the real Believers that had need to take heed of being Deceived, with fair Shews and rough Garments, for the Hypocrites are deceived already: But what Doctrine <hi>John Reynolds</hi> doth judge in theſe he calls filly Seducers and Quakers, to be amiſs, and by theſe two men he writes unto to be taken heed of, may gathered out of theſe Queries, to inſtance ſome.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe they ſay Chriſt Lighteth every man with a ſufficient Light that cometh into the World</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97179:82"/>2. Becauſe they ſay, That the Meaſure of the Spirit of God in man is the true and certain trier of all Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe they ſay, Chriſt himſelf and not the empty declaration without, is the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe they ſay, Chriſt the better hope, being come, ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thorough him is attainable here.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe they ſay, Judgment is commited to the Saints even whilſt they are in the Body, and therefore ſuch may Judge; and yet, ſay they, it is not fleſh, but Spirit that Judgeth all things.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe they make Conſcience of ſaying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is the plain Language.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Becauſe they ſay, that all Honour, and Glory, and Worſhip is to be given to God alone, and not to any Creature.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Becauſe they ſay, The true Church is in God, and ſo no Unrighteous One in it, or of it, and ſo can neither call the Wicked God's Church, nor a Houſe of Wood and Stone his Church.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Becauſe they cannot own the Worlds Sprinkling of Infants with a little outward Water, for Chriſt's Baptiſm; and becauſe they cannot own that for a right Communion, which is in Sin, and who eat Bread and drink Wine in Remembrance of a Coming of Chriſt, which they ſay ſhall never be while they are here, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But now ſomething, the Lord aſſiſting, may be ſpoken parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Anſwer to the Queries themſelves; and the firſt of them is this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query</hi> 1. Firſt Queſtion; If that Light which is within every Man that cometh into the World, be ſufficient without the Preaching of the Goſpel, how is it that Heathens know little or nothing of the True God?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, That thou run'ſt here upon a falſe Ground, and ſo draws this and the reſt of thy ſtumbling Conſequences from thy own Imaginations, not from our Words, for we do not Exclude the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel from the Light, nor the Light from it; but ſay, <hi>That is the true Light that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> one loves the Light, believes it, and follows it, and is led to God, and ſo ſaved by it ſufficiently; the other hates it, and it is his Condemnation: And this is the Goſpel Preaching, and this Light of Chriſt in every Man is the Light of the Glorious Goſpel, whether it be declared of to the outward Ear in Words or not; but he that Preaches not this True Light, Preaches another Goſpel, though there be not another Goſpel: And I ſay unto you, all People, if a ſeeming Angel Preach not this Goſpel of Light, this Grace of God which brings Salvation, which hath appeared to all Men, and is the Saints Teacher and Keeper, he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97179:82"/>is to be accurſed: But whereas thou tell'ſt of Heathen: Anſwer, All are Heathens now, and Ignorant of the True God, who know nothing of the ſufficiency of the <hi>Light that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> but thou askeſt in the end of that Query two very Childiſh, Queſtions: The firſt, Why we exhort all Men to follow the Light within, if that be ſufficient? I anſwer, Becauſe it is ſufficient, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we Exhort all Men to follow it, for that which is not ſufficient is not ſafe to follow: And ſo you that are ſo full of words, and ignorant of the Sufficiency, beat the Air and deceive the People, keeping ſilly Women ever Learning, and never able to bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, which perfects to God all the comers thereunto. Thy ſecond Query there, How could the Word of God be called a Myſtery hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifeſt, if the Light within be ſufficient? And then quotes <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. I anſwer, That it was within, and ſufficient when it lay hid as a Myſtery, till God's full time came of revealing it; and therefore Chriſt compares it to many Powerful and Precious, though hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things, and of little account to the outward view, as to a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed in the Earth, to a little Leaven within much Flower, to Treaſure hid in the Field; and Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that God's Kingdom was to be found in Man, he excludes none, and thoſe Scriptures thou ſett'ſt down prove for this Truth, and againſt thy ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mind which is in the outward obſervings, thinking to find the Kingdom there, when Chriſt ſaith, it cometh not that way, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20, 21. What, wilt thou conclude it was not, becauſe it lay hid? What <hi>Logick</hi> is this? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> there ſay, that the Myſtery which was ſo hid, and which he by the Spirit now Preached, <hi>which was Chriſt in the</hi> Gentiles <hi>the Hope of Glory?</hi> And Chriſt was Light, and to this Light he warned every Man to take heed; but the little Children, not the Maſters, obey the Voice, and ſo are led into the Underſtanding of the Myſtery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. In the next general <hi>Query</hi> thou askeſt, Are not the Scriptures the Words of the Lord, whoſe Words are they? And why is the Scripture ſo often called the Word of God, and the Word of the Lord?

That <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Hezekiah, Hear the Word of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord;</hi> and in other places of Scriptures, <hi>that the Word of the Lord came to the Prophets;</hi> and that in the fore-mentioned place of <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> mention is made of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preaching the Word of God, all this is true; but of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> mention is made of Words; but what doth all this prove, but only that the Word came to Holy Men, this Word was God, and as this Word moved in them, and gave them Wiſdom and Utterance, they writ or ſpoke forth Words as a Declaration of what was in the Mind, or Word of God, or what God was; and what, though the Scriptures may be thus called, The Words of the Lord, or his Prophets, or Apoſtles, Acted by his Power, which we never denied; this is nothing to the Hypocrites, who uſe their Tongues to ſay, <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> when he never ſpoke by them, but make a Trade of the Scriptures for filthy Lucre, and by their much preſſing the Declaration to be the Word of God, have quite clouded the Word it ſelf (Chriſt, from whence true Words come) from the Peoples Minds, ſo that ſcarce any have any true Living Feeling after God in his Word Chriſt; <hi>for in the beginning was the Word,</hi> before all Declarations, and ſhall be after all the Peaceable Life of all that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for ever: So that the Lord ſaw it good to ſtir up a People in theſe days to be True and Living Witneſſes of the Word, for the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Mouths of all ſuch as have gotten the Words, as Thieves from others, and ſo kept People in the form with themſelves, always Profeſſing, but never Poſſeſſing the Power which the Scripture Witneſs unto, and ſo the Letter and empty Words kill'd and do kill; but now the Living Spirit and Living Word being Witneſſed, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is owned in its place; and Reſurrection to Life being felt, the Crown is ſet upon the King's Head, whoſe Name is called <hi>The Word of God, who was, and is, and is to come, over all God Bleſſed for evermore;</hi> and it is conſiderable, that the Miniſters of Chriſt are never called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Letter, or Words, but of the Word and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and that Chriſt and his Apoſtles mentioning the Prophets Words, uſually called them <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not <hi>The Word of God,</hi> as the cuſtom of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> is now; <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs, and all outward Sounds and Signs vaniſh, but the Word of the Lord that endures for ever;</hi> and this is that Word which, by the Goſpel, (the Power of God) is Preached, and by nothing elſe ſavingly; which, when underſtood, People are One, but not before; for it is the weakneſs which is like the Womans ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes Diſſention; ſo let the Scripture have its due, and the Word of God its due, and all is Beautiful in its place.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this, I ſay, here thou manifeſts thy ſelf again; what ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is here in thy dark Mind? This is like the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Arguments to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but to this may be eaſily anſwered, that if it be manifeſt to the Conſcience of any, as Praiſed be God it is to many, that we are of God, ſuch a one will never ask ſuch a Queſtion as this: But now to you who cannot own the Light in your Conſciences, we cannot be manifeſt, becauſe the World knows us not; and then ask, where hath your Church been? I ſay, it hath been ever where it is at this day; to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97179:84"/>wit, the Church which is in God and Chriſt; which, when thou comeſt to the Light of Chriſt within thee, then thou wilt ſee, but till then we muſt be content to lye hid from thee, and all Dark Minds, and ſo to bear Chriſt's Reproach; but to all my dear Brethren in Chriſt, I ſay, Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God, Fellow-Citizens in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with all the Church of God, Firſt-born of God, whoſe Names are written in Heaven, therefore the World knows us not, becauſe it knew not our Head firſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. But as for thy telling of Eſteeming <hi>Self,</hi> and the name <hi>Quaker,</hi> and the like, thou may'ſt take thoſe words in again from whence they came, for Self and Names of Mens giving we deny; and Glory in the Croſs of Chriſt, where the Name of God is known; and as for the reſt of thy Queries, which tell of our unableneſs to give a Proof of ſuch People as we, before the laſt twenty Years, or ſo; who placed Religion in <hi>Thouing</hi> and <hi>Thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and refuſing to put off their Hats, and wear Decent Ornaments in their Apparel, and it is ſuch frothy ſtuff that it Shames thee and thy Profeſſion; but thou may'ſt know, that though you may do what you will that are without Law to God, yet we are taught to fear the Lord, and whatſoever is pure, to mind that, and ſo our Religion ſtands in Chriſt, not in outward Appearances, though the outward be all thou canſt ſee, and ſo ſtumbles at the meanneſs of it; but what are thoſe Decent Ornaments in Apparel thou tell'ſt on? Is needleſs Points, and Laces, and Ribonds, and ſuch filth? Then ſurely all Saints are one with us here; but for that thou ſay'ſt, we Rail againſt Prieſts Tythes, Idols Temples, and Idols Worſhip, being ſuch as yours; I ſay, though Railing we deny, yet we can eaſily prove by Scripture, that Holy Men Cried Vehemently againſt falſe Worſhips and Worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The next Query is ſomething to the former purpoſe, and ſo that which is ſaid may ſerve for that; but thou addeſt a great and wicked Lie and Slander, in ſaying, we condemn the moſt Eminent Saints and Martyrs, for thou ſay'ſt, they were not of our Minds; and thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97179:85"/>ſeemeſt much Troubled, that thy ſelf alſo (whom thou haſt ſo high an eſteem of) could not paſs the Cenſure of thoſe thou ſcornfully calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> have any of them called thee <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and the like? I ſay, ſee if it be not true that might be thus ſpoken unto thee, for it is no Derogation to the Honour of Truth, to ſay, the Truth it ſelf may call a Deceiver, falſe Accuſer, and Reproacher, by their proper names: For in <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. and <hi>John</hi> 8. ſee Chriſts Language to the Hypocrites of thoſe Days; ſo the Error was not in Chriſt his calling them ſo, that were ſo, but in thoſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> there calling Chriſt a Deceiver, and Devil, when he was not ſo, nor could be; and for the moſt Holy and Zealous Chriſtians amongſt you, that thou ſay'ſt, had the like Names from us: I anſwer, if any under the Name <hi>Quaker</hi> called thee or any of thy Company otherwiſe than they, in the Light, ſaw true, or could make good, they were to blame; but if any in Truth have declared your Inward Condition to you, though under ſuch Tearms, you ought rather to repent, than to kick and ſpurn at it in your hard Hearts; <hi>for it will be hard for you to kick againſt the Pricks;</hi> and for Spewing, you may take that to your ſelves, whoſe Throat is an open Sepulchre, wide opened againſt all that are Holy and Zealous in Chriſt, to ſeparate from you, and witneſs againſt your Deceit: And ſo if thoſe thou calleſt Holy and Zealous Chriſtians amongſt you, together with thy ſelf be weighed in the Ballance of Truth, it will appear you are as far from that State, as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I demand how thou knoweſt the Saints and Martyrs were not of our Perſwaſion and Practice? for thou doſt not judge with the Light that is Pure and Spiritual, as is manifeſt, nor ſee with a ſingle Eye, but only judgeth with thy Evil Thoughts and Falſe Imaginations; for we ſay in a few words, that our Mind and Practice is to believe on the Name of the Son of God, that true Light <hi>that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> and to love one another, and to labour to keep a Conſcience void of offence towards God and all Men: And I Read that the Saints and Martyrs were of this Perſwaſion and Practice with us, and ſo we have a Cloud of Witneſſes, both Ancient and Modern, of the Truth of this our way; and ſo if thou haſt Books that tell of other manner of Saints or Martyrs, I deny both them and thee, in calling them Saints, who are not; for the Saints of God and Martyrs of Jeſus are one Body in all Ages, not loving their Lives to death, that ſo they might always keep to God's manifeſt Truth in them without denying it before Men; and this is that which the Lord God hath wrought in us poor Deſpiſed People, to the Glory of his Grace in this his day, that no Fleſh might Glory, but as it is written, <hi>Let him that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, Glory in the Lord, who alone is worthy.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay, That the Teſtimony of thoſe thou ſcornfully calleſt <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt you, ſtands firm and true, for all theſe thy high ſwelling Words of Vanity; for we know none of you Preaching freely as yet, and the reaſon why you talk in the form, you do it becauſe you cannot keep your fat Benefices; O Hypocrites! What Whining and Complaining is there by you in theſe days for your Belly? But for Preaching the Goſpel, you have manifeſted your ſelves to be Ignorant both of Chriſt and of the Goſpel, by denying the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Light <hi>which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.9. and then put the Letter for the Light, and ſo fight and ſtrive with your Brethren about your form and ſeveral Imaginations of the Letter; one cries up a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> another a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and both of you Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true Biſhop and Elder. But <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> would'ſt not thou and thy Brethren be at the Gain from your Quarter again, if Common-Prayer could be diſpenſed withal? Oh if you be brought into ſuch a ſuffering Frame! How is it that we have no more of your Company in Priſon? Nay, nay, your old Heart is in you yet, and ye would be ſucking Lambs Blood ſtill if you had Power, and that the God of Heaven ſees, and will take Vengeance on you for it; and that which you cannot do with your Hands, you are doing with your Tongues and Pens, as is manifeſt. But I have often ſaid, if you could Preach freely; that is, without a ſet or forced maintenance, in the ſtate where you are, that would not at all commend you to God or his People: <hi>For you have run, and God never ſent you;</hi> and therefore you remain ſo ignorant of him, and profit not them that follow you; for when did Chriſt bid you go to the Univerſities of the World to learn him there? And when did he bid you go to ſuch a place, and ſuch a place, and there ſit down and Eat the Fat, and Cloath with the Wooll, and Preach the Thoughts of your vain Hearts, as you have done, and would do, and be guarded by the Magiſtrates Power, that none ſhould ſpeak to you in your high Places, nor going nor coming from thence? O call to mind the day of your fulneſs, and of your Pride; the ſame meaſure you mete to others is God meaſuring to you; you muſt be broken to pieces, becauſe you turn not to the Lord for all this: And to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed thing, the Light in your Conſcience, you muſt come and bow before it, as others have done, before you be healed; and if it give
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97179:86"/>you a word to ſpeak, you may ſpeak it; otherwiſe you muſt be ſilent, or you periſh: The Lord is ariſen, and ſo if indeed you can kiſs his Rod, you may find Mercy; but if you ſtill go on juſtifying your ſelves in his ſight, you ſhall certainly moulder to nothing; the Lord hath ſaid it, who is daily gathering his Lambs out of the Mouths of all Devourers, <hi>Glory to his Name for ever.</hi> But what Teſtimony of Jeſus can you either give or ſuffer for, who have ſo Vilified and Reproached the Spirit of Propheſie in Sons and Daughters, in Servants and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids in theſe Days? For the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie.</p>

In the former times, before the Wars when the Biſhops had Rule, there were ſome ſuch that could not conform to all the Fooleries of thoſe Days, and ſo could not enjoy their fat Benefices (though they loved them well enough) and ſo inſtead of ſuffering in <hi>Old-England</hi> fled into <hi>New-England</hi> to avoid the Croſs, and ſo in proceſs of time it came to paſs that they got the Magiſtrates on their ſide there; and then their Old Wolfiſh Hearts being ſtill in them, they fell on Perſecuting the Servants of God that came amongſt them to witneſs to Truth, inſomuch that of late Years they have ſucked the Blood of ſeveral of our Dear Members in Chriſt; Three they hanged on a Tree, cut the Ears of others, Tortur'd the Bodies of many with cruel Whippings, ſpoiled the Goods of many, and Baniſhed others for no other thing, but for owning the Truth as it is in Jeſus, and meeting to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>

Again, If all are Graceleſs perſons that are not Chriſtians; then is it not certain, that none but the Wicked did ever turn from us; then where is our Shame?

Nay, all muſt bow to the Son of God in his riſing and going forth; for his going forth is prepared as the Sun in the Morning, who rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his Courſe, and to this Juſt One muſt every Knee bow, and Tongue confeſs; for his Way is in his Light Shining more and more until it be high Noon and perfect Day: And the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though as honeſt as <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. and the <hi>Jew,</hi> though as blameleſs concerning the Law as <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt ſtate was, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. muſt bow to him: Yea further, <hi>Let all the Angels of God Worſhip him.</hi> But as for the Worlds Inhabitants, both Honeſt and Wicked, we know that the whole World lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And ſo, before you turn ſuch Chriſtians as quake and tremble at God's Word, and work out their Salvation in Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, you muſt be content to own your ſelves to be little leſs than Diſhoneſt, Wicked, and Graceleſs Wretches, though into the Truth Sinful Fleſh and Blood cannot enter; and though you will not now own the Grace of God to be your Teacher, and ſo in that reſpect may be called Graceleſs; yet you will one day know, that the Grace of God which brings Salvation, and would have taught you, did appear unto you all; and ſo God will be clear of all your Blood, and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction will be of your ſelves; and ſo becauſe you have not received this manifeſt Truth, the Grace of God to be your.

Thy Ninth and next Queſtion is about Ordination; and then Queries, To what purpoſe did the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Presbyters ordain Elders in every City with Faſting, Prayer, and Impoſition of Hands, if every Perſon that will, may run and ordinarily Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch Ordination?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I ſay, that the purpoſe of God in ordaining Elders in every City, as is mentioned in that <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. was not that proud and covetous Men (who have a little Worldly Wiſdom only to talk of the Letter and wreſt Scripture by) ſhould perk up and ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the place of God's Elders in God's Church: But that in this Church, by his Spirit in thoſe Elders, the Body might be Edified, and all kept in good order amongſt them through Love: Mind, this was the Church of God which was in God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. the Body of Chriſt, of his Fleſh, and of his Bone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23, 24. Not a Worldly People gathered in the Will of Man into a vain Form without the power; not I ſay, the Synagogue of Satan, who denies Perfection, and the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt's Light: And that there is none knows any thing aright, but by the Letter, as this <hi>John Reynolds</hi> pretends is not true; for the Church of God was taught of God, and the Elders in this Church were not brought up at the Worlds Schools of Learning, nor called of Men <hi>Maſter,</hi> nor Hirelings, nor Perſecutors of the Innocent, as the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of theſe days are; but they were Holy Men of God, of mean account in the World, raiſed up meerly by God's Power, out of the Heatheniſh and Jewiſh Worſhips, to know Chriſts Spirit, and his Anointing in them which taught them all things; and they were not ſuch as got the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to help them to great Livings and fat Benefices, and compel all by his Iron Sword to come in to them, but they were Sufferers under the Powers of the World, as we are at this day.</p>
                     <p>But whereas thou ſpeakeſt of every Man that is not ſo ordained, thy ſelf, and your ſelves, who never were ordained by the Holy Ghoſt, as they were; for when did the Holy Ghoſt in your Aſſemblies ſay, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. <hi>Separate ſuch and ſuch, for the work I have appointed them unto.</hi> Nay, nay, you have run and God never ſent you; for you never heard his Holy Voice at any time; and therefore you profit not the People at all, but make them more Cunning to Diſpute againſt the Truth, than they were before they followed you.</p>
                     <p>But what Ordination of Man had <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt going out to Preach? See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. he received not the Goſpel by Man, and went not to Man, no not to the Apoſtles themſelves for Ordination and Commiſſion to

Thy Tenth and next Query, is a plain diſcovery of thy Folly, and of thy manifeſt Enmity againſt the ſimple Appearance of Truth in any diſcovery; and though thou ſay, the Scripture is thy Rule, yet by it thou canſt not endure to be Ruled, but plain Language it ſelf is thy Burthen; and therefore thou askeſt, how it can be ſaid that ever Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or Patriarchs, or Prophets uſed the words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> when they never ſpake <hi>Engliſh?</hi> And how can it be unlawful for us to uſe the word <hi>You</hi> to each other, ſince the ſame words in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> that ſignifie <hi>Thou,</hi> ſignifie <hi>You</hi> in the Singular Number alſo, and may be Tranſlated <hi>You</hi> as well as <hi>Thou,</hi> and ſo it ſeems thou ſay'ſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.27.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw, John Reynolds,</hi> Didſt thou Read this Query twice over? Or didſt thou at all Conſider what thou ſaid'ſt in it? Was either the Fear of God, or Care of thy own Credit before thy Eyes when thou writeſt it? Surely neither. But thou haſt judged in thy ſelf with thy vain Thought, that becauſe thou haſt uſed to blind thy poor Hearers, and make them believe any thing for Truth thou ſpeakeſt or writeſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be ſo with others: Nay, nay, the Day is dawned, the Lord hath given his People an Eye whereby all Covers are ſeen through; and to this Light thou haſt manifeſted as much Nakedneſs and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be in thee, as in the groſſeſt of them that ſay Maſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> or read Common-Prayer in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Nay, I do believe many of them would be aſhamed to argue thus, as thou doſt; to wit, becauſe Chriſt, his Apoſtles, Patriarchs and Prophets did not ſpeak in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, that therefore they uſed not the words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee:</hi> How came the Tranſlators to Tranſlate their Words, when they ſpeak to a particular Perſon, <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> and never <hi>You,</hi> as may all over Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be eaſily found; thou may'ſt as well ſay, Chriſt, his Apoſtles, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Prophets ſaid nothing at all that is Recorded in Scripture in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, becauſe they ſpoke not <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo the Lord hath

Thy Eleventh and next Query is for the World, where thou undertakeſt the part of an Advocate for Fleſh; not only pleading for the Honour that is below, but alſo for the Manner of it. Thy Doctrine is very pleaſant to the fall'n Man, and the World cannot hate ſuch Preachers as thee; for ye are not only of the World, but chief Maſter-Builders of the old Houſe of the fall'n <hi>Adam,</hi> who loves the Earthly Honour. But now that Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is come, the Lord from Heaven, above the Earthly Man, let all Fleſh bow before him, and give up his Honour to him; otherwiſe this ſhall be fitly applied unto you that Chriſt ſaid unto the <hi>Jews, How can you believe, that not only receive, but alſo ſeek, and plead for Honour one of and from another?</hi> John 5.44. <hi>For Chriſt received not Honour from Men,</hi> Verſe 41. So that tho' there was a time that Angels were bowed unto, which were greater than Fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.1. yet a time came that Angels denied that Honour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. For now the Son himſelf was Glorified, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>And let all the Angels of God Worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 16. <hi>And at his Name ſhall every Knee bow,</hi> Phil. 2.10. And Chriſt ſaid to the Devil, who was like his Children, that would now be Worſhipped, <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> would be bowed unto, but the true <hi>Jew</hi> will bow only to God: But thou querieſt, and ſay'ſt:</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1626"/> All that the Saints before the coming of Chriſt did, is not to be an Example to us now; but we muſt all now, that would be approved to Chriſt, take him for our Example, and to follow no Man for our Example, further than they followed, or do follow him; and when the Apoſtles ſpeak of Honouring all, it muſt be underſtood (as in ſome place is mentioned) in the Lord; and that is not with Cap and Knee, and falſe Flattering Titles, and Geſtures, as the World uſeth; but in Heart and Truth, as the Spirit of God moveth: So that a Man muſt firſt be in the Lord (out of the firſt fall'n falſe Mind) otherwiſe he knows not at all how to Honour either God or Man, but is a Diſſembling Wretch, making fair Shews outwardly of Love, where nothing but War and Self-love is in the Heart: See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.9, 10. <hi>Jude</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>Thus Children being in the Lord, do, through the Lord, Honour Parents aright; thus Servants in the Lord, Honour their Maſters after the Fleſh aright; and ſo Church-members the Elders, Wives their Husbands; the Ruled the Rulers: Yea, thus they Honour their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Brethren aright; and in a Word, all Men; and ſo the Scripture is fulfilled in them: But what Honour do theſe Faithful Ones look for from Men? Nay, nay, they believe and ſeek for that Honour that comes from God only; and ſo the Scripture will not help the fall'n Man now to his Honour, which is his Life; but as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that would ſave his Life, muſt looſe it.</hi> And ſo all you, Hypocrites of the World, who are giving Honour to Proud Fleſh, and receiving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from it, ceaſe your Work, and let Chriſt have his due, or verily he will break you all in pieces with his Iron Rod. But in the end of thy Query, thy Conſcience a little checking thee for this vain Work, thou wouldſt daub over the matter, by telling People the Honour from below, which thou haſt been pleading for, muſt not be in Oppoſition to, but in Subordination to God's Honour: Nay, nay, I ſay, the true Chriſt, the Son of God is come, and all Power in Heaven and Earth is given to him; and ſo all Honour, and Glory, and Worſhip is his due (and the due of none elſe) to whom be it given of all his Angels and Servants, both now and for evermore. So all People, hearken and hear a word for your good; would ye be Honoured? Then Honour the Lord by obeying his Voice, and he will Honour you in due time, though for doing his Will you looſe the Worlds Honour, as aſſuredly ye will, if once ye be Faithful.</p>

And thou querieſt, whether that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry can be lawfully Condemned as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> which the Lord hath owned and ſealed with the Converſion of many Souls.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1662"/> To which, I ſay if your Miniſtry were ſuch as this thou ſpeakeſt of, then indeed it were not ſafe to condemn it: But where are theſe Converts thou ſpeakeſt of; to be a Convert, is to be turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God; bring forth the Man that can witneſs thee to be a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel this way, that he may give us an Account of the true Hope, if he have it in him: <hi>But Men cannot gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles;</hi> ſo thou being ſuch an Evil Tree, as thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf in theſe Queries to be, how can a true Convert be expected from ſuch a Miniſtry? But thou ſay'ſt, its in Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that many ſtubborn Sinners have been brought down unto their Faces, and to confeſs that God is in you of a Truth: But I ſay, it will be hard for thee to bring forth ſuch a Man; for when I uſe to come amongſt you to declare Truth againſt your Deceit, as the Lord ordered me, I found a heap of hard-hearted Sinners, more like to deſtroy the Creature, than to be Witneſſes of Truth. O ſhameleſs Men that bring forth ſuch bad Fruit! And yet, with a Whores Fore-head, dare take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſpeaks of Prophets in God's Church in God's Power, and apply it to your ſelves, who deny the ſufficiency of Chriſt's Light in Man; and know nothing but meerly by the Letter without, as thou for thy own particular haſt made manifeſt, and ſo are ſenſual, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit, as was noted in the third Query.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve alſo, in this preſent Twelfth Query, the Ignorance of the Grace of God; for when thou haſt falſly Boaſted of your Miniſtry what it hath done, thou ſay'ſt, is not this the Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation? <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. I ſay no; your Miniſtry, not being the true, is far from being the Grace of God there ſpoken of: But if it were the true Miniſtry, it were not that Grace there ſpoken of; for the true Miniſtry is but a ſervice to that Grace, not the Grace it ſelf; for the Grace of God is that which hath appeared unto all Men, and that which brought Salvation to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> as God's Gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Words or Works, and which was the Teacher of the Apoſtles themſelves, as well as others: And ſo when People would have been ſetting up <hi>Paul</hi> for his Miniſtry's ſake, he denied it, as nothing in compariſon of the All-ſufficiency of the Grace of God, and the Word thereof, to which only at beſt he was but a Servant. But if it could be manifeſt, that any under or amongſt you were Convinced of the Evil of their Ways in ſome meaſure; and ſo in their Dark Minds ſet upon a ſeeking after the unknown God, which is the moſt can be found amongſt you, and that rarely neither; this is no warrant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them to ſtay with you, who are Ignorant of the Way out of Sin unto God, neither is it any proof for you to be Goſpel-Miniſters,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97179:89"/>nor your Miniſtry to be a Goſpel-Miniſtry: For the Goſpel-Miniſtry is not only Convincing, but Converting and Perfecting, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. which work ye have utterly denied, and ſo ſhut out your ſelves for ever from the Goſpel-Miniſtry; and amongſt the Prieſts of the Letter, Law at beſt, muſt you be reckoned, which made nothing Perfect; and hence it is that you are ſuch bitter Enemies to the Spiritual Miniſtration, or New Covenant mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.

In this next Query thou goeſt on ſeeking falſe Covers to hide thine and your Nakedneſs, asking; How can the <hi>Quakers</hi> Condemn your Congregations, becauſe of ſome Wicked Unprofitable Hearers, when Chriſt himſelf (ſay'ſt thou) did not Convert all his Hearers? And for this thou bringeſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. I ſay, all this will not cover your Nakedneſs, Oh ye Teachers! nor your Congregations; for what have you to do to compare your ſelves with Chriſt and his Holy Prophets? You that deny the Immediate Revelations and Teachings of God's Infallible Spirit in theſe Days, and inſtead thereof, ſet up Schools of Humane Learning to make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by. O Hypocrites! When will you give over perverting the right Ways of the Lord, and leading the Blind into the Ditch?

They are not Hirelings, and Fighters, and Pleaders for the Worlds Gain, as you are: And ſo, tho' all that heard the outward Declaration, or Sound of Chriſt, or his Prophets Words were not Converted, yet that makes nothing for you, who have only a Sound, and ſo Convert none to God: But, as I ſaid before, beget them into your own Images, making them more able to Diſpute againſt the Life of Truth than ſome others, and ſo greater will be your Condemnation: But now your Sheeps-Cloathing being pull'd off, the Lord will be Glorified in his Power, in the Converſion of many to himſelf without you: For he hath rejected your Confidence, and laid waſte your Mountain, and the Mountain of the Lords Houſe is on the top of all your Mountains in this great Day of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

And for the outward Drunkards and Harlots, and ſuch like (though we cannot but reprove and caſt them out in that State) yet this we ſay of them, that they may ſooner enter into the Kingdom of God than you that judge your ſelves free, and are not; for you are ſo Painted and Conceited, <hi>that it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of Needle, than for you to enter in,</hi> and this makes your Wound more Uncureable; for you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter in your ſelves, nor ſuffer others.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, You have indeed an outward Temple or Houſe made with Hands to Worſhip in of your own devizeing, the Old Popiſh Maſs-houſe, and ſo cannot be called the Fathers Houſe of Prayer ſo well as the <hi>Jews</hi> was; for the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was made by God's Appointment for the outward Circumciſion to Worſhip, in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Law, as a Figure of Chriſt's Body to be Magnified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he whipt Buyers and Sellers then out of the Figure, as he doth now out of the Subſtance; but you have not only the Enemies Nature in you, but you have brought forth his Work into open view in your outward Temples alſo, which were never Built by God's Command, and ſo there is Buying and Selling amongſt you, as was amongſt them, as every Eye ſeeth: For there you Men made Prieſts, ſell Words, the Words out of dead Books to the People, and they give you their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Glebe-land, and Tythes for them: O filthy Merchandize! The Lord hath ſhaken his Hand at your diſhoneſt Gain, and is whipping out ſuch Merchants by his Powerful Truth out of his Houſe; and your dead Works, which you ſell at ſo dear a Rate in your Stone-houſes, which you call <hi>Churches,</hi> ſhall no Child of Light ever buy of you: For the true Bread of God, his free Gift, is now witneſſed, Praiſes for ever: One ſort of Merchant Prieſts ſell their Sermons and Maſs to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Money, another ſort their Common-Prayer and Sermons, and the third their Sermons and Directory.</p>
                     <p>And thou, <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> pleadeſt alſo for Synagogues and Pulpits, and when thou haſt ſet down Scriptures that tell of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, Synagogues, and Pulpit, thou askeſt, if Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not reſort to theſe places to inſtruct the People? To which I anſwer, Firſt, That whilſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People ſtood, Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go into their Temple and Synagogues to Preach the Goſpel of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97179:91"/>Kingdom, and ſo an end of thoſe things, and to bring them out of theſe things which they and you ſo much dote on; and plead for: but they did never Command Chriſtians to Build ſuch amongſt them, but told them, <hi>Their Bodies were the Temples of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. <hi>and that thoſe that abide in the Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans never ſo confined themſelves or others to any ſuch place for the Exerciſe of their Conſcience in the Worſhip of God, but met as the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles did; much leſs did they ſtir up the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and drive the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their Temple and Synagogues, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> out of theirs, that ſo they might creep into their Houſes, and under another Form of Worſhip live upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts Tythes, Offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor upon the Maintenance of the Idolatrous Prieſts of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the like Idols; as you Prieſts, to the ſhame of your Profeſſion, have done, and do at this day: What, have you driven the Papiſts out of their Maſs-houſes, and do live upon their Prieſts Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Tythes, Glebe-lands, Smoke-mony, Garden-pence, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the reſt of their Fooliſh things? What, cannot a Man be Born, Marry, Live, nor Die, but you muſt have Mony for it! O Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and Filthy thing! ſtop your Mouths for ever, for your Folly is manifeſt to all, and you can proceed no further: And ſo you Prieſts of the laſt Order, called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> did not you drive out the Prelates out of their Houſes, which they had gotten from the Papiſts, and there you ſate down Feeding upon the Spoil of the People, as your Fathers had done, and now think much that you are driven out again? And thus you fight with, and drive out one another like wild Beaſts, ſtriving each of you to get Power of others to be great in the Earth, and do what you will in your fat Paſtures. But, as I ſaid, the Lord is ariſen to whip you all out, and to pull down your Neſts, and to reſtore all things to their Primitive Purity, as in the beginning before the Temples, Tythes, Pulpits, and ſuch things were.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I conſider, that though I read that Chriſt and his Apoſtles went amongſt the People in their Temple and Synagogues, as we do at this day, to Preach the end of theſe things, and ſo to bring People to the Word that was in the Beginning, before all things, that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might be in Spirit and Truth, as it ought to be, <hi>John</hi> 4. Yet I never read, that either Chriſt or his Apoſtles got up into their Pulpit, nor ever Commanded his to perk up into a Pulpit of Wood over the People, as a Maſter of a Synagogue, to tell his Thoughts of the Letter, as you do: For though <hi>Ezra,</hi> a Prieſt of the Law, had his Pulpit or Tower of Wood to Read or Expound the Letter in, in thoſe days, before the Life was manifeſt; yet now the Life Chriſt Jeſus is ariſen, whoſe Voice in the Heart, and in all places is to be heard, without a Pulpit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97179:91"/>and without Mony, and without Price; and the Apoſtles Preached this Goſpel in Towns and Countries, where neither Temple, Synagogue, nor Pulpit was, but Tumults rather; and ſo the Goſpel is not a thing that will ſet up its Servants in Worldly Honour, but indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, which <hi>he that hath an Ear may hear,</hi> but the Wicked is ſo Proud in Heart, that neither Preacher nor Profeſſor amongſt them will ſtoop to the ſimplicity of it.</p>
                     <p>The next thing Conſiderable in this <hi>Query</hi> is, thy twiſting and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep up the Honour of the old Maſs-houſe, however, if it be but a Name, though it want the Nature, yet if thou canſt ſave that, thou thinkeſt better that than nothing; and ſay'ſt, What, though the Saints of God are called the Church; yet that cannot hinder the Houſe, where the Church meets, from being called a <hi>Church?</hi> A Profound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning! What, is this the Fruit of your cried up <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities?</hi> What, muſt every Place, where any People meet, be calledby the Name of that People? What Logick is this? Surely the Wiſdom of the World makes haſte into its Nothing again; God is utterly Confounding it. Do you call the place where the Parliament or Privy Council ſit, the Parliament or Privy Council? Do you call a Barn, or ſuch a mean place, where the Saints of God now a-days often meet, by the Name of a Church? If we ſhould Reaſon for the places where we meet, as you do for yours, ſurely you would Laugh at us, and might then well call us filly Women and Seducers indeed.</p>
                     <p>But, to go on, thou bringeſt a Scripture as though thou would'ſt prove the thing, and it is <hi>Acts</hi> 19.37. but the place being well weighed ſhames thee the more; for the words in that place are the words of a Town-Clark, a Worſhipper of Idols, and they are theſe, <hi>For you have brought hither theſe Men, which are neither Robbers of Churches</hi> (as K. <hi>James</hi>'s Tranſlators of the Bible have it,) but in the Tranſlation of the Bible by <hi>Beza,</hi> it is, <hi>You have brought hither theſe Men, which have neither committed Sacriledge; nor,</hi> &amp;c. if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken to him or others, and called a Stone-houſe a Church, as ye do, it had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe; but the Heathen ſpeaking there of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> improperly Tranſlated <hi>Robbing of Churches,</hi> can neither be underſtood to ſpeak of a Chriſtian Aſſembly, nor the place where they Aſſemble; for the Covetous and Idolatrous Copper-ſmith, and his Rude Fellows, matterr'd little what <hi>Paul</hi> had done to theſe; but this Sacriledge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, it muſt needs reſpect ſomething that the Heathen had in great Eſteem: But thou bringing this to prove that a Houſe may be called a Church, becauſe of the Church that may meet in it, is nothing at all to the purpoſe; for thou wilt not ſay, it's like that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of <hi>Diana</hi> were the Church; for he that runs without Light muſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97179:92"/>needs ſtumble, if not fall often. So <hi>J. R.</hi> walk more ſoberly, and take ſome Light along with thee, when thou haſt to do in ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>Then the laſt thing in this thy Query is a ſecret Confeſſion of a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy own Arguments in this matter; and thou ſay'ſt, What tho' the Worſhip of God be not ſo tyed to any place, as formerly; yet there ſhould be convenient places for the Church to meet in?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, The Worſhip of God now is not tyed to any ſet place at all, and ſo all your ſet places, that you plead for, are in the will of Man; and the true Church God both hath and will order it, and provide convenient places for it to meet in, though the World cannot hardly afford it on Earth a place to meet in at all. And for that thou concludeſt and ſayeſt, What though our Churches have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Abuſed to Idolatry; So were the Temples and Synagogues abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Idolatrous and Superſtitious Worſhip, yet nevertheleſs did Chriſt and his Apoſtles make uſe of them: I anſwer, What uſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles made of the Temple and Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is in part before declared: To which this may be added;</p>
                     <p>As for Chriſt, he was, according to the Fleſh, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and ſo he was to cleanſe the Temple, a Figure of his Body, and fulfil the reſt of the Laws, Shadows and Cuſtoms; and ſo end them all, and through the Goſpel bring Life and Immortality to Light, and to Conſecrate the New and Living Way through the death of all old things; for he Nailed them all to his Croſs, and they died with him; but he aroſe from the Dead, and not to bring up the old Dead things again, as thou <hi>J. R.</hi> and thy Generation would have, but to make all things New; for ſaith he that ſitteth on the Throne, <hi>Behold, I make all things New,</hi> Rev. 21.5. Glory to his Name for ever; but none can ſee God in his Throne, but in the Light that comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from him, <hi>which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> which the Worlds Builders did always deny and reject, as they do at this day: And for the uſe the Apoſtles made of the Temple or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was, as is formerly ſet down, to reaſon with them there of things pertaining to the Kingdom of God; the <hi>Jews,</hi> not the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being Aſſembled there, as the Servants of God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the World <hi>Quakers,</hi> do at this day, to bring People both then and now from the Shadows unto the Subſtance Chriſt Jeſus, who hath ſaid of his Body, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and I will build it again in three days;</hi> and ſo the three days being come and finiſhed, the Temple that is Holy was built again, and God Worſhipped and Glorified in it; but nothing that is defiled or loves a Lie can enter into, or be joyned unto it: But the <hi>Jews</hi> were more reaſonable in one thing than you <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are, for they ſuffered <hi>Paul,</hi> it ſeems, to Reaſon with them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97179:92"/>ſeveral of their Sabbath-days in their Aſſemblies quietly; but now, if any come amongſt you upon the liek account that <hi>Paul</hi> did, it's hard for ſuch to eſcape your Furious Hands, or a Priſon in theſe days: Whereby it appears your time is but ſhort, you are ſo unreaſonable and full of rage.</p>
                     <p>But the uſe that thoſe Goſpel-Miniſters the Apoſtles made of the Jewiſh Synagogues, will not ſerve your turns, O Pariſh-Maſters! for unleſs you may have them in your own diſpoſe to bring the World into them, to call you Maſter, and put into your Mouths, it will not anſwer your luſtful Mind: And ſo indeed, with you that have put the Name of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> upon the Wild World; a great Stone-houſe Faſhioned to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, with an addition of an high Steeple (<hi>Babel</hi>-like) with Bells in it, ſeems moſt convenient, though it was not only abuſed too, but even built for Idolatry ſo much: But for the little Flock of Chriſt in Cities, Towns and Villages, a leſs Houſe when they they need one, will be as much, if not more convenient: And to conclude, whereas thon intimateſt, that your great Stone-houſes, which thou calleſt <hi>Churches,</hi> though formerly uſed to Idolatry, yet now they are free; I ſay, thou wilt want proof for this, ſo long as you continue in the Worſhipping and Serving of Creatures; (and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine continues true, which ſaith, <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry;</hi>) unleſs you repent and bring cleaner Veſſels into your Temple than you do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. Thy Fourteenth <hi>Query</hi> was for Set-places, now this the Fifteenth is for Set-times; and thou askeſt, Had not the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Set-times for Publick Worſhip as well we?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, I ſay, the Saints amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> had their Set-times for their Worſhip better than you; for they were under the Law, and that was their Warrant; but you are neither under, Law nor Goſpel in Truth, but ony Carnal Imitators in your Will, ſometimes of the one Cuſtoms, and ſometimes of the other, as your Self-willed and Self-ended Hearts in your blindneſs Prompts you unto; and ſo for this, I ſay, Love the Light which Chriſt hath lighted you withal, and it will lead you to Repentance from all your vain Obſervings; and in the Light wait, that God's good Spirit you may know, and receive to Teach you, and lead you into all Truth, according to the Promiſe; and ſo wait in the Light that lets you ſee your wants, that's the Holy Place, and wait there for him in his Fear, that comes in his own, not Man's time; and be not as the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that think to be heard for their much wording of it, nor ſpread abroad the Sails of your vain Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when you Pray as the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> do, leſt <hi>Satan</hi> Transformed carry you about, and fill you with the Wind of his Frothy Spirit, making you believe you Pray with Gods Spirit, when it is his own lying Spirit, as his Cuſtom is amongſt you to work.</p>

So thou having ſpent thy Strength in Pleading for your Set-Places and Times, in Imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> thou goeſt on in this Query, endeavouring to prove your Work on theſe times, in thoſe places, from the likeneſs of them, to theirs then. And thus as you do, ſo do the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their Cuſtoms, for they Reaſon as thou do'ſt: For had not the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſay they, a Temple and Synagogues; So we: Had not they One High Prieſt? So we, who is called a Pope, had not they an Altar, and Sacrifice outward? So we; Had not they their Set-Faſts, and Muſick in their Temples, and Quiriſters, and Tythes, and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſuch things? And ſo have we, ſay they: So ſaith <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> here in this preſent Sixteenth Query: Had not the Saints in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times the Scriptures Read in their Congregations, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. and ſometimes Expounded, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.7, 8. and Prayed there, Verſe 6. and Singing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms there, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. &amp;c. and Bleſſing the People in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.23. &amp;c. Well, this was ſo under the Law, but what wilt thou infer from this, that you may continue the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſuch things; that follows not, unleſs you will deny the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. from 8. to 17. for the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law, and ſo they had a Worldly Sanctuary, and a Worldly Service, with divers Ordinances of that Nature, until the time of Reformation by Chriſt raiſed up, and come again in Spirit, and then ſays God, <hi>Behold I make all things New;</hi> and ſo he that is in Chriſt is a New Creature, Old things paſſed away, all things become New; New Temple, New Offerings and Service, New Prayers, Singings, Preachings, which no Worldly Man can get into, but all with the Holy Spirit and with Underſtanding: But thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeveral places out of the Writings of the Apoſtles, and <hi>Luke,</hi> as in <hi>Acts, Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to prove that the Apoſtles and Saints uſe Praying, Preaching, Pſalms, and Bleſſing amongſt them: Yea, but what is that to you, that deny that Infallible Spirit of God to be Head in you that guided them; and ſo get the Worlds Wiſdom, Acts, and Helps inſtead thereof, to make you Miniſters and Saints by. You have indeed in ſome things a Form of their Works, but the Power being found, not only wanting amongſt you, but denied by you; the Children of Light are neceſſitated to turn away from you, and thus to witneſs againſt you.</p>
                     <p>But thou ſay'ſt, Chriſt did not only Read the Letter in the <hi>Jews</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, but alſo Preached from a Text of it: To which I anſwer, For his Reading, he did upon account of being a <hi>Jew,</hi> to fulfil all that Righteouſneſs of the Law in his day till his Offering up; but that he Preached from a Text, as you Prieſts do, I utterly deny. For his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time was only this; He being Reading in the Prophet, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97179:93"/>is mentioned in that Fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in providence meeting with that place, which ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath Anointed me to Preach the Goſpel, he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted,</hi> &amp;c. And the Spirit of the Lord ariſing in him in Life and Power, and Witneſſing in him to the fulfilling of that Scripture in himſelf, <hi>He was overcome with Love and Glory, and ſo cloſed the Book, and gave it again to the Servant, and ſate down; and ſo the Eyes of the People were faſtened on him through Admiration, and Raviſhments of Love and Spirit that was upon him;</hi> and ſo as that Living Spirit gave him Utterance in the Silence of all Fleſh, he ſpoke to them, and Preached in many Gracious Words the fulfilling of that Scripture in the Ears of that Day: And this was Chriſts doing there.</p>
                     <p>But, O you poor naked Teachers of <hi>England!</hi> &amp;c. What have you to do to boaſt of this Example for warranting your Practice? There was no chooſing a Verſe in a Chapter in the Will of Man, which you think you can raiſe moſt words from, and ſo conſult with your own Imaginations and old ruſty Books, how you may raiſe an Hours Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from it, and ſo divine to pleaſe the itching Ears of Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that they may give you outward Honour, Glebe-lands, Tythes, Augmentations, <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Reckonings, and the like to pleaſe your Luſts; and if need be to Fight for you, and lay their Sword and Law upon all that will not hold you up, and Cry <hi>Peace</hi> to you: O Hypocrites! How have you deceived the poor People with your long wreſtings of Scriptures? But now that the Spirit of Truth is come, it is leading us into all Truth without your help, Praiſed be the Lord for ever.</p>
                     <p>And ſo for Chriſt his Expounding out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and opening the Underſtanding of the Diſciples to know the Scripture mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. And <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expounding and Teſtifying of the Kingdom of God, and Perſwading the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning Jeſus, both out of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of the Prophets mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. is nothing to you who now a-days (inſtead of Teſtifying to the Kingdom of God, and opening the Underſtanding to know Scriptures, and the Light of the World, which they witneſſed unto) do Teſtifie of this World, Pleading for your Carnal Ordinances, Set Places, Set Times, Bowing one to another, and the like, as is manifeſt in theſe Queries; and ſo inſtead of opening, ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, and ſo with theſe of old, <hi>will neither enter into the Kingdom of God your ſelves, nor ſuffer others;</hi> but are under the Wo, as you and the People, may Read all along in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.

                        </gap> a Blind follower of the Blind Guide <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> whoſe Argument this is, thou would'ſt not, it's like, have offered to bring this for this purpoſe, for it ſhames you all for ever: But this Argument being too weak for thee, thou endeavoureſt by another Argument, as little to the purpoſe, to prove the Natural Infants Subjects of Water-Baptiſm, becauſe, ſay'ſt thou, they have received the Holy Ghoſt, or elſe how could the Kingdom of God conſiſt of ſuch? To this I anſwer and ſay, But which of the Natural Infants which you ſprinkle hath the Holy Ghoſt, and which not? How come ye to ſee this difference? Or, you will ſay, that all have it; if ſo, then may People have the Holy Ghoſt ordinarily by Natural Birth, without hearing; then where is your great Glorying of your Words or Sermons? But to proceed, thou ſay'ſt, Can we imagine that God will give them the Kingdom, and deny them Water-Baptiſm? I anſwer, God will give the Kingdom of Heaven to whom it belongeth, and it conſiſteth not in outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Waſhings, as Dipping, or Sprinkling, or ſo, but in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: And thou that, with the Papiſts, attributes ſo much to Water-Baptiſm, how comes it to paſs, that after all your Sprinkling the Children, as they grow up in Years, many grow up in ſo much Wickedneſs and Vanity, as is every where manifeſt? And as concerning Children of Believing Parents, we deny them to be Believers that hate the Light, and believe not in it, but ſay, <hi>it is Inſufficient,</hi> as before is declared. But as for that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. which thou and thy Brethren uſually bring for your Cuſtom of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sprinkling of Infants; I ſay, it makes nothing for you, who ſit down in ſome Fat Benefice or other, as times favour you, and there Divine from the Letter, as is ſaid, an Hours Diſcouſe or two in a Week to the People for Mony: Why go you not into all Nations, as they did, and Diſciple the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> if you will be warranted by this Scripture? But whereas you take the Apoſtles for your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I query firſt, When did ever the Apoſtles go to the Schools of the World ſo many Years to be made Miniſters? Did ever the Apoſtles ſeek to the Magiſtrates to compel People to pay them Wages,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97179:95"/>as you do, or compel People by their Sword to conform to Chriſtian Doctrine? Or when did they ſprinkle Infants, receive Tythes of the People, or Sing <hi>David</hi>'s Prayers, Quakings in Rhime and Meeter, as you do? When were they called <hi>Maſter,</hi> as you are? And many the like things, wherein you differ as much from the Apoſtles, as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Light, whereby you ſhew your ſelves to be Guided by a contrary Spirit, (to wit) the Spirit of Error: So for ever be ſilent, and ſtop your Mouths, for you are both out of the Apoſtles Doctrine and Practice, as your Fruits make you manifeſt.</p>

And thou ſay'ſt, What a vain pretence is it to ſay, We Eat Chriſt Spiritually? I ſay, it it vain, if it be but in Pretence; but if it be in Truth, it is the greateſt thing, for it is <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> and he that thus Feeds upon Chriſt's Body is Alive to God: But you in all, your other Eatings and Drinkings, are Dead whil'ſt you Live: And ſo of you, that would keep People always in the Figures and Signs, ſaying, <hi>The coming of Chriſt,</hi> ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>is never to be witneſſed here:</hi> I demand, Whether that Cup which the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we Bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt; And the Bread which we Break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt: For we being many are one Body, and one Bread; for we are all Partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.15, 16, 17.

                     <p>But you whoſe Fear towards God is taught by the Precepts of Men, in vain is all your Worſhip; for I Teſtifie for the Lord, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, though it had the very Form of the Saints Practice of old, which yours have not, and not led thereinto by the Motion of the Eternal and Infallible Spirit of Life, it is nothing but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Men, and Will-worſhip, and no better than Offering Swines Blood, or cutting off a Dogs Neck: and for the endeavouring to keep up your Cuſtom of Praying, and Singing in mixt Congregations, from the Example of <hi>Jews,</hi> or them that follow Chriſt; I ſay, your Hypocritical Praying and Singing is good no where, but Rejected of God; and I ſee thy P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now that Chriſt is come, to ſet up this his Holy Glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Hearts of the Children of Men; where is this Faith to be found on Earth?

What Darkneſs have you wrapt your ſelves in? and how is the Underſtanding Part clouded in you, that you will neither ſee nor learn to know the things that pertain to Everlaſting Life? Can you ſay the Branches of the fallen Tree, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> are Unholy and Corrupt, becauſe of the Unholineſs of the Root? And will you not ſee that the Members of the Heavenly Man, Chriſt Jeſus, who never fell, are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe of the Holyneſs of the Root? For if the Root be Holy ſo are the Branches. Anoint your Eyes with Eye-Salve, that if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97179:101"/>poſſible you may ſee, and know a better Root in you, than the fallen Mans Nature, to grow on, that the Kingdom of Holineſs you may feel come near you; For they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may profeſs: And this adds to their Miſery, that when they have brought forth the Deadly Works of the Fleſh, they would charge them upon Gods Elect, and make their Works like their own: Theſe Fleſhly ones are great Enemies to Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, and his Members; for they that are in Chriſt are New Creatures; and to <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offering God hath ſtill Reſpect, though <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering was always Rejected, becauſe Polluted with Sin; as the Prayers and Performances of all Hypocrites are at this day: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, and is at this Day Received of the Faithful, even to deſtroy Sin, which is the Devils Work. And in him, to wit (Chriſt Jeſus the Light) is there no Sin, nor Sinſul Narure.</p>
                  <p>So they that Love Chriſt, and Walk in his Life, and Light, pleaſe God; for he is that Way Undefiled, wherein no Unclean can Walk: but the Redeemed are here: And what if I ſhould ſet down the words of Jeſus, to wit, <hi>Whoſoever abideth in Chriſt, Sioneth not; whoſoever Sinneth, hath not ſeen him nor known him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6.

O! that you could be perſwaded of this, how well would it be for your Poor Souls in time to come.</p>
                  <p>Therefore now that the True, Heavenly, Everlaſting, All-ſufficient Light is broken forth again, from under the Clouds, after the long Dark Night of Apoſtacy; turn your Minds in, to know a meaſure of it in you, and wait therein to be led out of all the Dark Paths of Sin and Error by it: For I am the Way, ſaith Chriſt, the Light, that true Light which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World; and I will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97179:101"/>ſend my Holy Spirit of Truth to lead into all Truth: He is come, and his Promiſe fulfilled; Glory to his Name forever. And do you not know that Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates, ſaith the Apoſtle? And if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, then have we fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another, and the Blood of this innocent Lamb cleanſeth from all Sin, and waſheth from all Unrighteouſneſs all real Comers thereunto, ſaith the ſame Spirit: Therefore go not forth, for without are Doggs, and all Liars; but Truth and the Kingdom of it, is to be found within, nigh in the Heart.</p>
                  <p>O how Beautiful is the Way of the Juſt! Holineſs is the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their Reins continually, their Hearts ponder deep things in Holineſs; they do no Iniquity who walk in this Everlaſting Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed WAY, Chriſt Jeſus, the Light; for, by the Light are they led out of all Defilements; and to ſuch there is no occaſion of Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>O ſtoop down low with your minds to the Light of Chriſt in you, that convinceth you of Sin and Evil, that through the Light the true Door, and Daily-Croſs to the Carnal Mind, you may come into the Sheep-fold; for all who clime up another Way, are but as Thieves and Robbers, and muſt be judged as Goats, and ſet on the left hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not hear Chriſt's Voice, the Light in the Conſcience, to be led by it. Great Wo to the Climers over the Door; ſuch neither receive Chriſt, nor his Servants whom he ſends; but chooſe rather to follow ſuch as love to be called of Men, <hi>Maſter,</hi> and live in the reſpect of Perſons, and Perſecuting Nature, and daub over an old Heart with fair Promiſes of Life, as it is amongſt you this Day; for what tho' ſome in the outward ſtand againſt you for your Form, and Words ſake, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> of old did the outward <hi>Jews,</hi> yet both thoſe outward <hi>Jews</hi> then, as you outward Profeſſors do now, ſtood and do ſtand, againſt Chriſt, and us for his Truths ſake: For we find it true from you all, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever walketh in Chriſt, and holdeth forth his Life, and ſo Worſhippeth God in Spirit and Truth, ſhall be hated of all men, whether Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors or Prophane, who are out of that Life and Holy Worſhip, even for Chriſts very Name and Life's ſake, becauſe it is a Croſs and Offence to all the World, who are in their own Wills, under what Form or Profeſſion ſoever, who are gotten into a Profeſſion of Chriſt, without Chriſt, and the daily Croſs which his Followers bear. Therefore all who are climed up into the Tree of an outward Profeſſion without the true real ſeeling and Spiritual acquaintance with the daily Croſs, and fiery Law of the Lord, and flaming Sword (which Guards the Tree of Life) which is in the Hand of the Angel of the Covenant, for the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of the Man of Sin (that the Birth Immortal, which is Holy,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97179:102"/>may onter in and poſſeſs the Inheritance) muſt come down again; I ſay they muſt come to the beginning, from which in their fallen Wiſdom they are wandred, to learn of him in Silence, who ſpeaks from Heaven, whoſe Word is nigh in the Heart, before ever they be eſtabliſhed; for except you become as little Children, not in Talk, but in Truth, ye cannot enter God's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>O ye People, hearken awhile, whether Teachers or Hearers; You who have been feeding upon the Tree of Knowledg, and never came through Gods Judgments, the Flaming Sword, to the Tree of Life: Your Food is Death, your-Works will Burn, and your Fig leaf-Covers will fall off you, and you be left Naked and Bare to the ſhame of your Nakedneſs, as in the day that you were Born: For what is any Covering unleſs it be that of the Spirit of Chriſt? The Lord God, who is of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, will bring your Deeds to the Light of his Judgments, from which you cannot flee; and before him will nothing ſtand but that which is Pure.</p>
                  <p>Your defiled Preachings, Prayings, Singings, Hearings, Readings, will be rejected, and caſt out as Dung from the Preſence of the Pure Holy God, that is a conſuming Fire: You have multiplied words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge: Ye have not been, neither yet are ye Doers of Gods Will (to the Witneſs of God in your Conſciences, I ſpeak) therefore in vain do you ſay, Lord, Lord; and he will not hold them Guiltleſs that take his name in Vain. Your Garment is not of the Pure White Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, which is the Saints Righteouſneſs; but Linnen and Woollen is your Covering, a thing forbidden by Gods Law. Your Field is not ſowen with the one Heavenly kind of Grain (the Good Wheat) but another Seed have you mingled with it, and the mixture is ſo great, that the <hi>Bad</hi> hath almoſt choaked and covered the <hi>Good</hi> in you: If you will work you muſt into Gods Vineyard, and be exceeding Diligent and Laborious (in Spirit) in plucking up the Weeds by the Roots in you; the Light of Chriſt in your Conſcience waiting in it will give thee Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: But Wo will be to them who call the Light Darkneſs, and put Darkneſs for Light; and ſo ſuffer the Good in them to wither, and nouriſh the Bad Part in them (which is like the Grave, that never hath enough) but is always learning at Man without, and not at Chriſt within, and Miniſtring from the outward Dead Spirit of the World, and not from the meaſure of the Living Spirit of Chriſt; and ſo not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed to the Word of Faith, which is nigh in the Heart (the Word of Chriſt which is Spirit and Life) they never get Victory over their Sin, as is manifeſt, but go laden, Teacher and Hearer, all their Life long, with divers Sins and Luſts, as was ſaid before. So Wo to the ſelfiſh Workers, who ſpeak their own words, and think their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97179:102"/>own thoughts on this the Holy Sabbath Day of the Lord God, wherein he hath given his People reſt from all their weary La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Burdens: The outward Day, the firſt Day of the Week ſhall not Cover you; nor be a Sabbath to you, but in the breach of Gods Holy and Everlaſting Spiritual Sabbath of Reſt, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, you muſt bear his Judgment. Behold, all ye that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a Fire this Day, and that compaſs about your ſelves with Sparks, walk in the Light of your Fire, and in the Sparks that ye have kindled; yet know, that your reward from the Lords Hand, is to lie down in Sorrow. I ſay, all you who feed upon, and whoſe Faith ſtands in, the wiſdom of Vain Mans words, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in the ſubtility to pleaſe the itching Ear, and not in the Power of God, which waſheth the inſide; a Day of Scattering cometh upon you, it cometh, and a grievious Whirl-wind from the Lord; and the Pleaſant Breaſts of <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> which you ſo much delight in, ſhall be dried up; for the Lord hath reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your <hi>Confidence,</hi> becauſe you have rejected his <hi>Good Word</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> and choſen your own Deluſion, and evil entreated his Servants, whom he ſent, riſing up early, and ſending them time after time, to warn you to come out of all your Dead Forms, and Dead Faith, into the Living Virtue and Power of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit of Truth, to Worſhip him there, and to know it in you; but you would not; therefore the Lord will yet do that <hi>Great Work</hi> and <hi>Wonder</hi> amongſt you; he will confound the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of your Wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtanding of your Prudent Men, and they ſhall be as <hi>Women,</hi> weak and feeble; the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; and the Songs of your <hi>Temple</hi> ſhall be Howlings in that Day, becauſe of the Vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that will bear no more Grapes; but ſo many as have drunk of the Wine of her Fornication, muſt Drink of the Cup of Gods Wrath. And all you who talk of your Faith and ſuffering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and yet Live in your Sin, you know not what Spirit you are of; for the ſame mind, that you think to ſuffer in, is it which by Transgreſſion grieves the Spirit of God, and ſtands againſt the ſetting up of his Kingdom in your ſelves, and the Teſtimony thereof in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Ones this Day: And ſo, if you could give your Bodies to be burnt, in this your Unſaved and Unſanctified Condition, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit you nothing at all. Wherefore come out from amongſt them, all you that would be happy, and touch no unclean thing, but give your Hearts to the Lord, to know his Light in you, to teach you; and he will receive you, and hide you from the Wrath that is to come upon all that are not in him, as ſaith his Spirit in his Servant.</p>

                  <p>THE Lord, even the Lord God, of infinite, endleſs, Glorious Power and Truth, plead our Cauſe, our Innocent Cauſe, againſt you the Rulers of this Nation, and of all the World, who hate us, and Perſecute us without a cauſe. The Lord hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us up in Righteouſneſs, ever Praiſed be his Name, to bear our Teſtimony for God and his Chriſt, againſt all the Ways and Falſe Worſhips of Fallen Man; and therefore it is that ſuch as are in the fall, through the Ignorance and Evil that is in them, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us with the Tranſgreſſors, and account all manner of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Grievances too little for us; Yea, Baniſhment, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, Spoiling of our Goods, and Death it ſelf is Judged not leſs than we deſerve: So the Scripture is fulfilled, ſee <hi>John</hi> 16.2, 3.
